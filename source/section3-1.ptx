    <title>The Idea of a Limit</title>
    <p>
      There are many instances when studying natural phenomena where we wish to know what happens near a point,
      but not specifically at a point.
      Alternately,
      we may wish to know about the long-term behavior of a quantity,
      but not specifically at some time in the future, no matter how distant.
      The mathematical idea of a "limit" is precisely designed to describe such things using the language of functions.
      Instead of looking at the output value of a function when plugging in a specific input,
      we look at the pattern of the output values over a sequence of input values.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Using Limits to Describe Zeno's Paradox</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Zeno's paradox<fn>
          See a delightful Numberphile video at
          <url href="https://youtu.be/u7Z9UnWOJNY">https://youtu.be/u7Z9UnWOJNY</url>
          for more on Zeno's Paradox and infinite processes.
          </fn> is a wonderful example of a limit.
          Consider that in moving from one place to another,
          you must first travel half the distance,
          then half of the remaining distance,
          then half of that remaining distance, etc.
          Since there will never be zero distance left to travel,
          you will never reach your destination.
          We can express these distances as a sequence of fractions of the total distance:
          <me>
            \left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \ldots\right\}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that each term in the sequence has the form
          <me>
            \frac{1}{2^n}
          </me>
          for a positive integer <m>n</m>.
          Note as well that as <m>n</m> increases,
          the denominator <m>2^n</m> increases,
          with the result that the fractions
          <m>\frac{1}{2^n}</m> become smaller and smaller as <m>n</m> gets bigger and bigger.
          Eventually, the fractions <m>\frac{1}{2^n}</m> are so small as to be indistinguishable from zero;
          in a theoretical way we have not yet reached our destination,
          but in a practical sense, it makes no difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the "limit" notation that you will be learning in this section,
          we would express this idea as
          <me>
            \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{2^n} = 0
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          What it is saying is that we will eventually have 0 distance left to travel,
          though it will take us infinitely long to get there.
          So do we ever actually get where we are going?

      While interesting,
      thousands-of-years-old Greek riddles are not our main motivation for being interested in limits.
      Instead, they are motivated by the hundreds-of-years-old<fn>
      Calculus was invented in the 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz
      (independently, and they disagreed with each other).

      </fn> question, "How much is a quantity changing?" We already studied one way to answer:
      average rates of change.
      The following example shows how this answer can be made more precise by studying smaller and smaller intervals of time,
      resulting in a limit.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_fallingball">
      <title>Instantaneous Velocity as a Limit of Average Velocity</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Recall that,
          for an object moving in a straight line with position function <m>s(t)</m>,
          the <em>average velocity</em> of the object on the interval from <m>t=a</m> to <m>t=b</m>,
          denoted <m>AV_{[a,b]}</m>, is given by the formula
          <me>
            AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}
          </me>
          where <m>s(t)</m> is the position of the object.
          Average velocity is the same as average rate of change of position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that the height <m>s</m> of a ball at time <m>t</m>
          (in seconds)
          is given in feet by the formula <m>s(t) = 64-16(t-1)^2</m>.
          A graph of <m>s(t)</m> for <m>0\leq t\leq 3</m> is:
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="46%" source="ACPrev1-1-1Graph.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see from the graph that the ball is 48 feet high when it is released,
          it is 64 feet high at its highest point,
          which occurs 1 second after it is released,
          and that the ball lands after 3 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally,
          we can see that the ball is going up on the interval
          <m>0\lt t\lt 1</m> and going down on the interval <m>1\lt t\lt 3</m>.
          Think about what the ball is doing at the exact moment corresponding to <m>t=1</m>.
          How fast is it rising or falling?
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin to answer this,
          we could look at the average velocity of the ball on the half-seconds before and after <m>t=1</m>.
          On the interval <m>[0.5,1]</m> the average velocity is:
          <me>
            AV_{[0.5,1]} = \frac{s(1)-s(0.5)}{1-0.5} = \frac{64-60}{0.5} = 8 \text{ ft/sec. }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          On the interval <m>[1,1.5]</m>, the average velocity is
          <me>
            AV_{[1,1.5]} = \frac{s(1.5)-s(1)}{1.5-1} = \frac{60-64}{0.5} = -8 \text{ ft/sec. }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither of these seems particularly precise and we aren't sure what we should conclude. (Maybe you are.
          What do you think we should do with these two numbers?) Half-second intervals seem fairly long,
          so let's make the intervals shorter.
          <xref ref="tab_instvelocityfallingball" autoname="yes"/> below gives the average velocity on intervals that are smaller and smaller on either side of <m>t=1</m>:

        <p>
          We start to notice a pattern:
          the average velocities get smaller and smaller as the interval gets narrower and narrower.
          Because the numbers are consistently on either side of 0, we could now guess that the ball's speed at the precise moment <m>t=1</m> is 0 ft/sec.
          This momentary speed is called the
          <em>instantaneous velocity at <m>t=1</m></em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our answer makes some intuitive sense:
          for the tiniest fraction of a millisecond,
          the ball is suspended in the air before it begins to fall.
          This is similar to the moment on a swing when you reach the peak of your swing and feel weightless,
          before going the other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a limit, we express this idea as
          <me>
            \lim_{b\to a} AV_{[a,b]} = \lim_{b\to a}\frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a} = 0 \text{ ft/sec }
          </me>.
          This same idea of shrinking the interval was introduced in <xref ref="ex_teaserinstchangewithcomposition" autoname="yes"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, though,
          that we cannot simply have <m>b=a</m> in the average velocity formula,
          since in that case <m>b-a = 0</m> and we would be dividing by 0.
          So is the ball actually ever motionless in the air?

    <title>The Definition of a Limit</title>
    <p>
      Let's make these ideas more precise and also explain what this "limit notation" actually means.
      The basic idea is that we ask what output values the function gets close to near an input value.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def_limit">
      <title>Definition of a Limit</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a function <m>f</m>,
          a fixed input <m>x=c</m>, and a real number <m>L</m>,
          we say that <em><m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m></em> and write
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to c}f(x) = L
          </me>
          provided that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
          (but not equal)
          to <m>c</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we cannot make <m>f(x)</m> as close to a single value as we would like as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m>,
          then we say that <em><m>f</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m>. </em>Another way to say this is that the limit
          <q>does not exist,</q>
          and we abbreviate with
          <me>
            \ds \lim_{x\to c}f(x)  \text{ DNE }
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      \fbox{ The symbols <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L</m> are read, "the limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> of <m>f(x)</m> is equal to <m>L</m>." }
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of finding the limit of a function at a point that is not in the domain of a rational function:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_TaalmanPage95b">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the function <m>g(x) = \dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}</m> can be simplified by factoring the numerator as <m>\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1} = \dfrac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1}</m> so that
          <me>
            g(x) = \begin{cases}x+1, \amp  \text{ for } x\neq 1\\ \text{ undefined } , \amp  \text{ for }  x=1 \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then for values of <m>x</m> <em>near</em>
          1, the values of <m>g(x)</m> are still
          <em>near</em> <m>x+1=(1)+1=2</m>,
          even though <m>g(1)</m> is undefined,
          pictured in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage95b" autoname="yes"/> below:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_taalmanpage95b">
          <caption><m>\ds\lim_{x\to 1}g(x) = 2</m> but <m>g(1)</m> is undefined.</caption>
          <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage95b.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Note the small hole in the graph of the line at the point <m>(1,2)</m> because the graph does not actually contain this point.
          This is precisely the kind of situation that limits are designed for; we write
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1} g(x) = 2
          </me>
          because the limit does not care what happens <em>at</em>
          the point where <m>x=1</m>,
          only <em>close</em> to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this example <m>x=c=1</m> is the value that the input approaches,
          and <m>y=L=2</m> is the value that the outputs approach.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Many times, we can determine limits visually from the graph of a function,
      without needing to know the algebraic formula for the function.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_ACPreview1-2-1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>g</m> is the function given by the graph below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="46%" source="ACPreview1-2-1.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see by the closed dots on the graph that <m>g(0) = 1</m> and <m>g(1) = 3</m>.
          There is a hole at <m>x=2</m> so <m>g(2)</m> is undefined.
          Let's decsribe the limits of the function at all three of these <m>x</m>-values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Near <m>x=0</m>, the <m>y</m>-values of <m>g(x)</m> get close to 4.
          Even though the function is equal to 1 at <m>x=0</m>, the limit is
          <me>
            \ds\lim_{x\to 0}g(x) = 4
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the value <m>y=L=4</m> of the limit is not equal to the value of the function <m>y=g(0)=1</m>.
          This is because the limit only looks at what happens as <m>x</m> approaches <m>x=0</m>,
          not when it is equal to <m>x=0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Near <m>x=1</m>,
          we have a problem because some of the <m>y</m>-values
          (the ones to the left of the jump)
          get close to 3 while others
          (the ones to the right)
          get close to 2.
          Referring back to the definition of a limit,
          because the values of the function do not get close to a single value,
          this limit does not exist:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1}g(x) \text{ DNE }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Near <m>x=2</m>,
          the <m>y</m>-values of <m>g</m> get close to <m>y=L=1</m>,
          though they never actually get there because <m>y=g(2)</m> is undefined.
          Nevertheless, we write
          <me>
            \ds\lim_{x\to 2}g(x) = 1
          </me>
          to express the fact that for values of <m>x</m>
          <em>approaching</em> <m>x=2</m>,
          the <m>y</m>-values of <m>g(x)</m>
          <em>approach</em> <m>y=1</m>.

      It's not always the case that the output of a function will approach a finite number at a non-domain point.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-1)^2}
          </me>.
          We can see that the domain of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>x\neq 1</m> since the denominator is equal to zero when <m>x-1=0</m>,
          hence when <m>x=1</m>.
          Graphing <m>f(x)</m>,
          we see that the values of <m>f(x)</m> become infinitely large as <m>x</m> gets close to <m>x=1</m>:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage97a.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Because the values of <m>f(x)</m> do not approach an actual <em>number</em>,
          technically the limit <em>does not exist</em>
          according to Definition <xref ref="def_limit" autoname="yes"/>.
          However, we write
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1}f(x) = \infty
          </me>
          to describe the fact that the values of the function become infinitely large as <m>x\to 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      As a last preliminary example,
      let's see how to determine a limit numerically using a table of values.
      Before we begin this example, I want to establish that tables are a method that we are using <em>temporarily</em>
      until we learn algebraic methods for approaching such a problem.
      It is too laborious to use as a main method of finding the value of a limit,
      and is not necessarily precise.
    </p>

      We've seen that limits can be quite useful for describing what happens when a function is undefined.
      They are also useful for describing what happens when two parts of a piecewise-defined function do not line up smoothly,

      This means that in order for <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c}f(x)</m> to exist,

      <p>
        Remember that the phrase "if and only if" is shorthand for saying that one thing can only be true if the other is also true.
        In particular, if either right or left limit does not exist,
        or the left and right limits are equal to different numbers,
        then the two-sided limit does not exist.

          The purple sequence of values of <m>x</m> that approach <m>x=1</m> from the left determines a sequence of values of <m>f(x)</m> that approach <m>y=2</m>,
          while the red sequence determines values that approach <m>y=3</m>.
          The value of the function at <m>x=1</m> happens to be <m>f(1)=3</m>,
          but that is not relevant to either limit calculation.
          Since the limits from the left and right are not the same,

          We can see in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage97b" autoname="yes"/> that as <m>x</m> approaches <m>1</m> from the right,

          Thus from this we infer that the limit is approaching <m>-63.999999\ldots  = -64</m> and we write
          <me>
            \lim_{a\to 3^-} AV_{[a,3]}  = -64
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In context, we conclude that the ball is going 64 feet per second downward when it hits the ground.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    instantaneous velocity; limit of <m>f</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> is equal to <m>L</m>, written <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c}f(x) = L</m>; DNE, meaning "does not exist"; limit of <m>f</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m>  from the left is equal to <m>L</m>, written <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c^-}f(x) = L</m>; limit of <m>f</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> from the right is equal to <m>L</m>, written <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c^+}f(x) = L</m>.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The limit of a function describes the behavior of the <m>y</m>-values of a function <em>near</em>
      a point, rather than at a point.
      A limit does not exist if the <m>y</m>-values of a function do not approach a single number.
      We can take limits separately from the left
      (less than the input value)
      or the right
      (greater than the input value).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      A limit only exists if both the right and left limits exist and are equal.
      Even though we can write that a limit is "equal to infinity," such a limit
      <em>does not exist</em>.
      Instantaneous velocity is the (one- or two-sided) limit of average velocity.
