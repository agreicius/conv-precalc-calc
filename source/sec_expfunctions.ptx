    <title>Motivating Exponential Functions</title>
    <p>
      We saw in <xref ref="sec_avgchange">Section</xref>
      that linear functions have constant average rate of change while quadratic functions have a linear average rate of change
      (over intervals of a set length).
      After learning about derivatives,
      we know that all polynomials will have rates of change that are polynomial,
      of one lower degree.
      In this section,
      we will define and start to explore exponential functions,
      which have a fundamentally different pattern to their rates of change.
      It is this pattern that makes them exceptionally useful for modeling many real-world phenomena.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Modeling Percent Change</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's suppose that a credit card company is offering a 10% annual interest rate on a one-time loan.
          If you take out a loan for $100 and don't make any payments,
          after one year you still owe the original $100, plus 10% of $100,
          so your balance after a year is:
          <me>
            100\xrightarrow{\text{ year 1 } }100+0.1(100) = 100+(1+0.01) = 100(1.1)
          </me>.
          If we instead borrowed $100,000,
          after 1 year we again owe the original $100,000,
          but now we also owe 10% of $100,000,
          and thus the balance after a year is:
          <me>
            100000\xrightarrow{\text{ year 1 } }100000+0.1(100000) = 100000(1.1)
          </me>.
          If we were to borrow $P, we reason the same way that after a year the balance on the loan is
          <me>
            P+0.1P = P(1.1)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we go another year without paying anything toward the loan,
          we repeat our calculations for a second year.
          If we started by borrowing $100,
          after the second year we would owe
          <me>
            100\xrightarrow{\text{ year 1 } }100(1.1)\xrightarrow{\text{ year 2 } }(100(1.1))(1.1) = 100(1.1)^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we started by borrowing $100,000,
          after the second year we would owe
          <me>
            100,000\xrightarrow{\text{ year 1 } }100000(1.1)\xrightarrow{\text{ year 2 } }(100000(1.1))(1.1) = 100000(1.1)^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the same reasoning,
          if we borrow <m>P</m> dollars without paying anything back,
          in 2 years our loan will grow to
          <me>
            P\xrightarrow{\text{ year 1 } }P(1.1)\xrightarrow{\text{ year 2 } }(P(1.1))(1.1) = P(1.1)^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          What will happen after 3 years?
          Adding 10% to the loan balance of <m>P(1.1)^2</m> after two years,
          the original loan <m>P</m> will have grown to
          <me>
            P(1.1)^3
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 4 years, the loan balance will be
          <me>
            P(1.1)^4
          </me>
          and after 5 years, the loan balance will be
          <me>
            P(1.1)^5
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we see a new kind of pattern developing:
          annual growth of 10% is leading to
          <em>powers</em> of the base <m>1.1</m>,
          where the power to which we raise <m>1.1</m> corresponds to the number of years the loan has grown.
          Note that the change occurs in the
          <em>exponent</em> of the formula:
          <me>
            P(1.1)^t
          </me>
          where <m>t</m> is the number of years since we took out the loan.
          Each additional year results in an additional multiplication by <m>1.1</m>,
          so for each year that passes,
          the power of the base <m>1.1</m> will increase by <m>1</m>.
          This phenomenon is called <em>exponential growth</em>.

    <title>Defining Exponential Functions</title>
    <p>
      The pattern described by the example above is new to us.
      We have yet to see a function where the variable is in the exponent.
      Such a function does not fit into our previous classification of algebraic functions,
      and so it is the first of the <em>transcendental functions</em>
      that we will study this semester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Functions that are not algebraic are called
      <em>transcendental functions</em>.
      This semester,
      we will investigate four basic types of transcendental functions:
      exponential, logarithmic,
      trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions.
      Exponential functions look similar to power functions,
      but with the roles of constant and variable reversed in the base and exponent.

      <title>Exponential Functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <em>exponential function</em>
          is a function that can be written in the form
          <me>
            f(x) = Ab^x
          </me>
          for some real numbers <m>A</m> and <m>b</m> such that <m>A\neq 0, b>0</m>,
          and <m>b\neq 1</m>.

      Before moving on to exploring the properties of exponential functions,
      let's recall the rules of exponents so that we can work algebraically with these expressions.

    <title>Growth of Exponential Functions</title>
    <p>
      Let's look at another practical application of exponential functions in order to better understand their properties:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_APCPrev3-1-1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that at age 25 you receive a signing bonus of $20,000 at your new job<fn>
          Congratulations!
          </fn> and you can choose between one of two ways to use the money:
          you can invest it in a mutual fund that will,
          on average, earn 8% interest annually,
          or you can purchase a used car that will,
          on average, depreciate 12% annually.
          Let's explore how the $20,000 changes over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>M(t)</m> denote the value of the $20,000 after <m>t</m> years if it is invested in the mutual fund.
          Let <m>C(t)</m> denote the value of the car <m>t</m> years after it is purchased.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know that <m>M(0)=20000</m> since when <m>t=0</m>,
          you are starting with $20,000.
          After one year you will have 8% more, so that
          <me>
            M(1) = 20000+0.8(20000) = 20000(1.08) = 21600
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, a quantity increasing by 8% annually will be multiplied by 1.08 each year, so that
          <me>
            M(2) = 20000(1.08)^2 = 23,328\qquad\text{ and } \qquad M(3) = 20000(1.08)^3 = 25194.24
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A formula for <m>M(t)</m> after <m>t</m> years is then
          <me>
            M(t) = 20000(1.08)^t
          </me>.
          A graph of <m>M(t)</m> is
        </p>
        <figure>
          <caption><m>M(t) = 20000(1.08)^t</m> describes 8% annual growth over <m>t</m> years.</caption>
          <image width="56%" source="APCPreview3-1-1-M.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Let's now look at the value of the car.
          We know that <m>C(0) = 20000</m>.
          After one year, the value of the car will be 12% <em>less</em>
          than it was originally worth, so that
          <me>
            C(1) = 20000-0.12(20000) = 20000(1-0.12) = 20000(0.88)= 17600
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that if a quantity depreciates
          (meaning decreases by)
          12% annually, after a given year,
          <m>(100-12)\% = 88\%</m> of that quantity remains.
          So for each year that passes,
          we multiply by another <m>0.88</m>:
          <me>
            C(2) =20000(0.88)^2= 15488\qquad\text{ and } \qquad C(3) = 20000(0.88)^3= 13629.44
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A formula for <m>C(t)</m> after <m>t</m> years is then
          <me>
            C(t) = 20000(0.88)^t
          </me>.
          A graph of <m>C(t)</m> is
        </p>
        <figure>
          <caption><m>C(t) = 20000(0.88)^t</m> describes 12% annual depreciation over <m>t</m> years.</caption>
          <image width="56%" source="APCPreview3-1-1-C.png"/>
        </figure>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Note the very different behavior of the two functions: 8% growth results in an increasing,
      concave up function,
      while 12% depreciation results in a decreasing, concave up function.
      Both functions have a coefficient of <m>A=20000</m>.
      The only difference in the formula is in the base <m>b</m> of the exponential function:
      growth corresponds to a base of <m>b=1.08>1</m>,
      while depreciation corresponds to a base of <m>b=0.88\lt 1</m>.
      This is <em>not</em> a coincidence.
      Bases larger than 1 will increase as the exponent increases,
      while bases between 0 and 1 will decrease as the exponent increases.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an exponential function <m>f(x)=Ab^x</m>,
      we note that <m>f(0) = A\cdot b^0 = A\cdot 1 = A</m>,
      so an exponential function has <m>y</m>-intercept equal to the coefficient <m>A</m>.
      This is sometimes called the <em>initial value</em>
      of the quantity being modeled.
      In the example above, <m>M(0) = 20000</m> and
      <m>C(0)=20000</m> are the initial quantity of your bonus that you either invested or paid for the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that because a positive number raised to any power is always positive
      (for instance,
      <m>2^{10} = 1024</m> and <m>2^{-10} = \frac{1}{2^{10}} = \frac{1}{1024}</m>),
      the expression <m>b^x</m> is also always positive.
      An exponential function <m>f(x) = Ab^x</m> will then always be positive when the coefficient <m>A</m> is positive and will always be negative when <m>A</m> is negative.
      In particular, <m>f(x) = Ab^x</m> is never zero,
      and thus has no <m>x</m>-intercepts.
      In the example above,
      <m>M(t)</m> and <m>C(t)</m> both have positive coefficient <m>A=20000</m>,
      so these two quantities will always be positive for any value of <m>t</m>.
      This makes sense intuitively in both examples:
      the values of the mutual fund and car cannot be negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again looking at <xref ref="ex_APCPrev3-1-1">Example</xref>,
      we call <m>1.08</m> the "growth factor" of <m>M</m> and similarly <m>0.88</m> the growth factor of <m>C</m> because we are multiplying by that factor for each 1-unit increase in time.
      In addition,
      we note that these values stem from the actual growth rates:
      <m>8\% = 0.08</m> for <m>M</m>,
      so that the growth factor is <m>1+0.08</m>,
      and <m>-12\% = -0.12</m> for <m>C</m>,
      so that the growth factor is <m>1-0.12</m>,
      the latter growth rate being negative because value is deprecating.
      In general, for a function of the form <m>f(x) = Ab^x</m>,
      we call <m>b</m> the <em>growth factor</em>.
      Moreover, if <m>b = 1+r</m>, we call <m>r</m> the <em>growth rate</em>.
      Whenever <m>b>1</m>,
      we often say that the function <m>f</m> is exhibiting
      <em>exponential growth</em>,
      whereas if <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m>,
      we say <m>f</m> exhibits <em>exponential decay</em>.

          \end{subtable}
          \caption{Two different functions <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>, with equally spaced inputs.}
        </table>
        <p>
          In the left-hand table,
          we see a function that exhibits constant average rate of change since the change in output is always
          <m>\Delta r = -2</m> for any change in input of <m>\Delta t = 3</m>.
          Said differently, <m>r</m> is a linear function with slope
          <me>
            m =\frac{\Delta r}{\Delta t} =  -\frac{2}{3}
          </me>.
          Since its <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,12)</m>, the function's formula is
          <me>
            y=r(t) = -\frac{2}{3}t+12
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference between one output and the next is always a constant <m>-2</m>,
          as long as the input increases by 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          By contrast,
          the function <m>s</m> given by the right-hand table does not exhibit constant average rate of change:
          <me>
            AV_{[0,3]} = \frac{9-12}{3-0} = -1, AV_{[3,6]} = \frac{6.75-9}{6-3} = -0.75, AV_{[6,9]} = \frac{5.0625-6.75}{9-6} = -0.5625
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the difference between one output and the next is <em>not constant</em>
          as the input increases by a constant amount and <m>s(t)</m> is
          <em>not</em> a linear function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, observe that in the table for <m>s(t)</m>,
          <em>each output is a multiple of the previous output</em>.
          The first two outputs have a ratio of
          <me>
            \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4}
          </me>.
          The second and third outputs have a ratio of
          <me>
            \frac{6.75}{9} = 0.75 = \frac{3}{4}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The third and fourth outputs have a ratio of
          <me>
            \frac{5.0625}{6.75} = 0.75 = \frac{3}{4}
          </me>.
          For <m>r(t)</m>,
          we see that when the input increases by 3, the output is multiplied by <m>\frac{3}{4}</m>.
          As a formula,
          <me>
            s(t) = 12\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{t/3}

  <subsection>
    <title>Finding Formulas for Exponential Functions</title>
    <p>
      We now do some algebra.
      Recall that we can find the formula of a linear function from knowing only two points that lie on the line.
      Similarly, if we know two points on the graph of an exponential function,
      we can determine the function's formula.
      We demonstrate two different methods for doing so in the next example and the following exercise.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_APCExample3-1-6">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>p</m> is an exponential function and we know that <m>p(2)=11</m> and <m>p(5) = 18</m>.
          Determine the exact values of <m>A</m> and <m>b</m> for which <m>p(t) = Ab^t</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since we know that <m>p(t) = Ab^t</m>,
          the two data points give us two equations in the unknowns <m>A</m> and <m>b</m>.
          First, using <m>t=2</m>,
          <me>
            Ab^2 = 11
          </me>,
          and using <m>t=5</m> we also have
          <me>
            Ab^5 = 18
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we know that the ratios of outputs of an exponential function corresponding to equally-spaced inputs must be constant,
          we consider the ratio of our outputs <m>\frac{18}{11}</m>:
          <me>
            \frac{18}{11} = \frac{Ab^5}{Ab^2} = \frac{b^5}{b^2} =b^3
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solving for <m>b</m>, we find that
          <me>
            b = \sqrt[3]{\frac{18}{11}}\approx 1.1784
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the exact value <m>b = \sqrt[3]{\frac{18}{11}}</m> and substituting this value for <m>b</m> in <m>Ab^2 = 11</m>,
          we see that
          <me>
            A\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{18}{11}}\right)^2 = 11  \Rightarrow  A = \frac{11}{\left(\frac{18}{11}\right)^{2/3}}\approx 7.9215
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore,
          <me>
            p(t) =  \frac{11}{\left(\frac{18}{11}\right)^{2/3}}\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{18}{11}}\right)^t\approx 7.9215(1.1784)^t
          </me>
          and a plot of <m>y=p(x)</m> confirms that the function indeed passes through <m>(2,11)</m> and <m>(5,18)</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="46%" source="APCExample3-1-6.png"/>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <title>Another Approach</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="ex_APCExample3-1-6">Example</xref>,
          we saw that as the input <m>t</m> increases by <m>5-2=3</m>,
          the ratio of the outputs is <m>\frac{18}{11}</m>.
          Since the ratio of outputs is constant for exponential functions,
          another increase of <m>3</m> in <m>t</m> will result in multiplication by another <m>\frac{18}{11}</m>, so that
          <me>
            p(t) = A\left(\frac{18}{11}\right)^{t/3}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          From here, use the fact that <m>p(2)=11</m> (or <m>p(5)=18</m>;
          you can use either) to find <m>A</m>.
          Verify that this value of <m>A</m> is the same as was found in <xref ref="ex_APCExample3-1-6">Example</xref>.
          (You will probably want to write what you found as a decimal.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, observe that:
          <me>
            \left(\frac{18}{11}\right)^{t/3} = \left(\frac{18}{11}\right)^{(1/3)\cdot t} =\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{18}{11}}\right)^t
          </me>
          so that the base of the two functions is the same if we isolate <m>t</m> in the exponent.

                How do these different choices affect the shape of the graph?

                Why can't we use <m>A=0</m>?
                Set <m>A=0</m> in the Desmos graph.
                How does this change the shape of the graph?

                (if Desmos shows you anything;
                sometimes it doesn't).
                Think about what values we can have for the exponent <m>x</m> in the expression <m>f(x) = A(-0.5)^x</m>.
                What would happen with <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m>?
                <m>x=-\frac{1}{4}</m>?
                <m>x=\frac{97}{6}</m>?
                There are infinitely many values of <m>x</m> for which a negative base would result in an undefined expression.
                This is why the definition of an exponential function excludes <m>b\lt 0</m>.

    <p>
      If we consider an exponential function <m>f</m> with a growth factor <m>b>1</m>,
      such as the function pictured to the left below,
      then the function is always increasing because higher powers of <m>b</m> are greater than lesser powers (for example,
      <m>(1.2)^3>(1.2)^2</m>).
      On the other hand, if <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m>,
      such as the function pictured to the right below,
      then the exponential function will be decreasing because higher powers of positive numbers <em>less than 1</em>
      get smaller (for example,
      <m>(0.9)^3\lt (0.9)^2</m>).
      If you don't believe this, plug the numbers into a calculator.

    <p>
      We also notice that each graph bends upward and is therefore concave up.
      We can better understand why this is so by considering the average rate of change of both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> on consecutive intervals of width 1, so that the average rate of change can be computed by
      <me>
        AV_{[t,t+1]} = \frac{f(t+1)-f(t)}{1} = f(t+1)-f(t)
      </me>.
      The tables below give the average rate of change of <m>f(t) = 2(1.25)^t</m> and
      <m>g(t) = 8(0.75)^t</m> on several consecutive unit intervals:

      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      We can see that for <m>f</m>,
      the average rate of change is increasing as we increase the value of <m>t</m>.
      We say that <m>f</m> appears to be "increasing at an increasing rate." In other words,
      that <m>f</m> is concave up.
      For the function <m>g</m>,
      we first notice that its average rate of change is always negative,
      but also that the average rate of change gets <em>less negative</em>
      as we increase the value of <m>t</m>.
      Said differently,
      the average rate of change of <m>g</m> is also increasing as we increase the value of <m>t</m>,
      thus <m>g</m> is also concave up.

      Note the last statement:
      the graph of <m>f</m> passes the Horizontal Line Test.
      This is because <m>f</m> is either increasing or decreasing and so its graph cannot repeat values.
      Another way to say this is that exponential functions are one-to-one and that

          if <m>b^c = b^d</m>, then we must have <m>c=d</m>.
          Use this property to determine the value of <m>x</m> that satisfies each equation below.
          This will be useful in the next section when we want to find values of logarithms.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    transcendental function, exponential function; initial value, growth factor, growth rate, exponential growth, exponential decay.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Exponential functions model percent increase or decrease.
      We can describe this increase (respectively,
      decrease) via either a growth rate or growth factor
      (respectively, decay rate or decay factor).
      Exponential functions have a very predictable shape,
      determined by whether the coefficient is negative or positive,
      and whether the base is between 0 and 1 or greater than 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      Exponential functions are never equal to 0 and are always one-to-one.
      Their inverses are called logarithms.
