    <title>Applications: Drug Concentrations, Maximizing Profit</title>
    <p>
      In this section we will study two particular applications of optimization:
      modeling drug concentrations in a patient's blood stream and optimizing profit, cost,
      and revenue.
      Throughout, we will see how derivatives help us analyze the behavior of real-world phenomena that can have a major impact on people's lives.

    <title>The Surge Function and Drug Concentration</title>
    <p>
      First, a motivational example with some data:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_nicotine">
      <title>Nicotine in the Blood</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          When a person smokes a cigarette,
          the nicotine from the cigarette enters the body through the lungs,
          is absorbed into the blood, and spreads throughout the body.
          Most cigarettes contain between <m>0.5</m> and <m>2.0</m> mg of nicotine;
          approximately 20%
          (between <m>0.1</m> and <m>0.4</m> mg)
          is actually inhaled and absorbed into the person's bloodstream.
          As the nicotine leaves the blood,
          the smoker feels the need for another cigarette.
          The half-life of nicotine in the bloodstream is about 2 hours.
          The lethal dose is considered to be about <m>60</m> mg.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nicotine level in the blood rises as a person smokes,
          and tapers off when smoking ceases.
          <xref ref="tab_nic">Table</xref> shows blood nicotine concentration
          (in ng/ml)
          during and after the use of cigarettes. (smoking occurred during the first ten minutes and the experimental data shown represent average values for ten people.)

      Functions with the behavior exhibited in <xref ref="ex_nicotine">Example</xref>
      are called <em>surge functions</em>.
      They have equations of the form <m>y=ate^{-bt}</m>,
      where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive constants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's examine the family of functions <m>y=ate^{-bt}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What effect do the positive parameters <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have on the shape of the graph of <m>y=ate^{-bt}</m>?
      Let's start by looking at the graph in <xref ref="fig_surge">Figure</xref>
      with <m>a=1</m> and <m>b=1</m>.
      We consider the effect of <m>b</m> on the graph of <m>y=ate^{-bt}</m> first.
      Graphs of <m>y=te^{-bt}</m> for different <m>b</m> values are show in <xref ref="fig_diffbsurge">Figure</xref>.
      The general shape of the graph does not change as <m>b</m> changes,
      but as <m>b</m> decreases,
      the curve rises for a longer period of time to a higher value.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_diffbsurge">
      <caption>Graph of <m>y=te^{-bt}</m>, with <m>b</m> varying</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="Section-8-3-diffbsurge.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We see in <xref ref="fig_surgemax">Figure</xref> that,
      when <m>b=1</m>, the maximum occurs at about <m>t=1</m>.
      When <m>b=2</m>, the maximum occurs at about <m>t=1/2</m>,
      and when <m>b=3</m>, it occurs at about <m>t=1/3</m>.

      <caption>How does the maximum depend on <m>b</m>?</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="Section-8-3-surgemax.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The next example shows that the maximum of the function
      <m>y=te^{-bt}</m> occurs at <m>t=1/b</m>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_surgefunctionformulas">
      <title>Formulas for the Maximum of a Surge Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>b>0</m>, show that the maximum value of
          <m>y=te^{-bt}</m> occurs at <m>t=1/b</m> and increases as <m>b</m> decreases.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The maximum must occur at a critical point where <m>dy/dt=0</m>.
          Differentiating gives
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dt} = 1\cdot e^{-bt}+t(-be^{-bt}) = e^{-bt}-bte^{-bt} = e^{-bt}(1-bt)
          </me>.
          Since <m>e^{-bt}</m> is always positive, <m>dy/dt=0</m> only where
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}1-bt \amp = 0\\ t=\frac{1}{b}. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          By the Single Critical Point Theorem
          (<xref ref="thm_SCPT">Theorem</xref>),
          we only need to check that
          <m>t=\frac{1}{b}</m> is a local maximum in order to know that it is a global maximum,
          since it is the only critical point on the interval <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.
          To do this, we observe that the sign of
          <m>dy/dt = e^{-bt}(1-bt)</m> depends only on the sign of <m>1-bt</m>,
          since <m>e^{-bt}</m> is positive for all values of <m>t</m>.
          When <m>t\lt 1/b</m>,
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}t \amp \lt 1/b\\ bt \amp \lt  1\\ 0 \amp \lt 1-bt. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, when <m>t>1/b</m>,
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}t \amp >1/b\\ bt \amp > 1\\ 0 \amp >1-bt. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence <m>dy/dt = e^{-bt}(1-bt)</m> is positive for
          <m>t\lt 1/b</m> and negative for <m>t>1/b</m>,
          thus <m>t=1/b</m> is the location of a local maximum,
          and by the Single Critical Point Theorem, also a global maximum.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maximum <m>y</m>-value is found from substituting <m>t=1/b</m> into <m>y=te^{-bt}</m>:
          <me>
            y=\frac{1}{b}e^{-b(1/b)} = \frac{e^{-1}}{b}
          </me>.
          We can see that for <m>b>0</m>, as <m>b</m> increases,
          the denominator of <m>\frac{e^{-1}}{b}</m> will increase,
          making the value of <m>y</m> decrease overall.
          Thus the maximum value of <m>y</m> decreases as <m>b</m> increases.
          Similarly, when <m>b</m> decreases,
          the maximum value of <m>y</m> increases.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <p>
      The surge function <m>y=ate^{-bt}</m>,
      for positive constants <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
      increases rapidly and then decreases toward zero with a maximum at <m>t=1/b</m>,

      As with nicotine,

      If <m>t</m> is the time since the drug was administered,
      the concentration <m>C</m> can be modeled by the surge function <m>C=ate^{-bt}</m>,

      What factors affect drug absorption?
      Drug interaction and the age of the patient can affect the drug concentration curve.
      Food intake can also affect the rate of absorption of a drug.
      Perhaps most surprisingly,
      drug concentration curves can vary markedly between different commercial versions of the same drug.

          However, if propantheline is administered with paracetamol,

      Economists often think of the quantities supplied and demanded as functions of price.
      However, for historical reasons, the economists put price
      (the independent variable)
      on the vertical axis and quantity
      (the dependent variable)
      on the horizontal axis.
      (The reason for this state of affairs is that economists originally took price to be the dependent variable and put it on the vertical axis.
      Later, when the point of view changed, the axes did not.)
      Thus, typical supply and demand curves look like those shown below.

          What is the economic meaning of the prices <m>p_0</m> and <m>p_1</m> and the quantity <m>q_1</m> graphed above?
        </p>
        <p>
          The vertical axis corresponds to a quantity of zero.
          Since the price <m>p_0</m> is the vertical intercept on the supply curve,
          <m>p_0</m> is the price at which the quantity supplied is zero.
          In other words, for prices below <m>p_0</m>,
          the suppliers will not produce anything.
          The price <m>p_1</m> is the vertical intercept on the demand curve,
          so it corresponds to the price at which the quantity demanded is zero.
          In other words, for prices above <m>p_1</m>,
          consumers buy none of the product.
        </p>
        <p>
          The horizontal axis corresponds to a price of zero,
          so the quantity <m>q_1</m> on the demand curve is the quantity demanded if the price were zero <mdash/> the quantity that could be given away for free.

      Many economics decisions are based on analysis of the costs and revenues "at the margin," meaning the additional cost or revenue generated by producing and selling one additional item.
      For example,
      the additional cost "at the margin" of producing <m>q</m> items is
      <me>
        C(q+1)-C(q) = \frac{C(q+1)-C(q)}{(q+1)-q}
      </me>.
      We recognize this as the average rate of change of <m>C</m> on the interval <m>[q,q+1]</m>.
      If the graph of the cost function is not curving too fast near the point,
      the slope of the secant line is close to the slope of the tangent line.
      Therefore, the average rate of change is close to the instantaneous rate of change.
      Since these rates of change are not very different,
      many economists choose to define marginal cost, <m>MC</m>,
      and marginal revenue, <m>MR</m>,
      as the instantaneous rate of change of cost or revenue with respect to quantity:
    </p>

          is the instantaneous rate of change of the cost of producing a quantity <m>q</m> of some good.
        </p>

          The <em>marginal revenue</em>,

          is the instantaneous rate of change of the revenue from producing a quantity <m>q</m> of some good.

          The revenue graph is a line through the origin, with equation
          <me>
            R=pq
          </me>
          where <m>p</m> represents the constant price,
          so the slope is <m>p</m> and
          <me>
            MR = R'(q) = p
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The total cost is increasing,
          so the marginal cost is always positive.
          For small <m>q</m> values,
          the graph of the cost function is concave down,
          so the marginal cost is decreasing.
          For larger <m>q</m>, say <m>q>100</m>,
          the graph of the cost function is concave up and the marginal cost is increasing.
          Thus, the marginal cost has a minimum at about <m>q=100</m>.

    <title>Maximizing Profit and Revenue</title>
    <p>
      A fundamental issue for a producer of goods is how to maximize profit.
      For a quantity, <m>q</m>,
      the profit <m>\pi(q)</m> is the difference between the revenue,
      <m>R(q)</m>,
      and the cost, <m>C(q)</m>, of supplying that quantity.
      Thus <m>\pi(q) = R(q)-C(q)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we look at how to maximize total profit,
      given functions for revenue and cost.
      The next example suggests a criterion for identifying the optimal production level.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Estimate the maximum profit if the revenue and cost curves are given by the curves <m>R</m> and <m>C</m>,
          respectively, below:
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="37%" source="Hughes-HallettPage194.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since profit is revenue minus cost,
          the profit is represented by the vertical distance between the cost and revenue curves,
          marked by the vertical arrows.
          When revenue is below cost, the company is taking a loss;
          when revenue is above cost, the company is making a profit.
          The maximum profit must occur between about <m>q=70</m> and <m>q=200</m>,
          which is the interval in which the company is making a profit.
          Profit is maximized when the vertical distance between the curves is largest
          (and revenue is above cost).
          This occurs at approximately <m>q=140</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The profit accrued at <m>q=140</m> is the vertical distance between the curves,
          so the maximum profit is approximately <m>\dollar80,000-\dollar60,000 = \dollar20,000</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      We now analyze the marginal costs and marginal revenues near the optimal point.
      Zooming in on the picture above around <m>q=140</m> results in the picture below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <image width="37%" source="Hughes-HallettPage195.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      At a production level <m>q_1</m> to the left of 140,
      marginal cost is less than marginal revenue,
      as indicated by the slopes on the two curves.
      The company would make more money by producing more units,
      so production should be increased
      (toward a production level of 140).
      At any production level <m>q_2</m> to the right of 140,
      marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue.
      The company would lose money by producing more units and would make more money by producing fewer units.
      Production should be adjusted down toward 140.
    </p>
    <p>
      What about the marginal revenue and marginal cost at <m>q=140</m>?
      Since <m>MC\lt MR</m> to the left of 140,
      and <m>MC>MR</m> to the right of 140,
      we expect <m>MC=MR</m> at 140. (Note that we are assuming that cost, revenue,
      marginal cost,
      and marginal revenue are all continuous,
      so we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem!).
      In this example,
      profit is maximized at the point where the slopes of the cost and revenue graphs are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can get the same result analytically.
      Global maxima and minima of a function can only occur at critical points of the function or at the endpoints of the interval.
      To find a critical points of profit <m>\pi(q)</m>,
      look for zeros of the derivative:
      <me>
        \pi'(q) = R'(q)-C'(q) = 0
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So
      <me>
        R'(q) = C'(q)
      </me>,
      that is, the slopes of the graphs of <m>R(q)</m> and <m>C(q)</m> are equal at <m>q</m>.
      In economic language,
    </p>
    <p>
      \fbox{The maximum
      (or minimum)
      profit can occur where
      <me>
        \text{ Marginal profit }  = 0
      </me>
      that is, where
      <me>
        \text{ Marginal revenue }  = \text{ Marginal cost }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, maximum or minimum profit does not <em>have</em>
      to occur when <m>MR=MC</m>;
      either one could occur at an endpoint.
      The Example below shows how to visualize maxima and minima of the profit on a graph of marginal revenue and marginal cost.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The total revenue and total cost curves for a product are given below:

          <image width="41%" source="Hughes-HallettPage196a.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          The graphs of marginal cost and revenue are below.
          Note that <m>R(q)</m> is a straight line,
          hence <m>MR</m> is a horizontal line,
          and that <m>C(q)</m> is always increasing,
          so <m>MC</m> is always positive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="37%" source="Hughes-HallettPage196b.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Where is profit maximized?
          We know that the maximum profit can occur when Marginal revenue = Marginal cost,
          that is where the curves above cross at <m>q_1</m> and <m>q_2</m>.
          Do these points give the maximum profit?
        </p>
        <p>
          We first consider <m>q_1</m>.
          To the left of <m>q_1</m>, we have <m>MR\lt MC</m>,
          so <m>\pi' = MR-MC</m> is negative and the profit function is decreasing there.
          To the right of <m>q_1</m>, we have <m>MR>MC</m>,
          so <m>\pi'</m> is positive and the profit function is increasing.
          This behavior, decreasing and then increasing,
          means that the profit function has a local minimum at <m>q_1</m>.
          This is certainly not the production level we want.
        </p>
        <p>
          What happens at <m>q_2</m>?
          To the left of <m>q_2</m>, we have <m>MR>MC</m>,
          so <m>\pi'</m> is positive and the profit function is increasing.
          To the right of <m>q_2</m>, we have <m>MR\lt MC</m>,
          so <m>\pi'</m> is negative and the profit function is decreasing.
          This behavior, increasing and then decreasing,
          means that the profit function has a local maximum at <m>q_2</m>.
          The global maximum profit occurs either at the production level <m>q_2</m> or at an endpoint
          (the largest and smallest possible production levels).
          Since the profit is negative at the endpoints
          (because <m>R\lt C</m> at the endpoints),
          the global maximum occurs at <m>q_2</m>.
          A graph of <m>\pi(q)</m> is below:
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="41%" source="Hughes-HallettPage196c.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that since <m>R(0)=0</m> and <m>C(0)</m> represents the fixed costs of production,
          we have <m>\pi(0) = R(0)-C(0) = -C(0)</m>.
          Therefore the vertical intercept of the profit function is a negative number,
          equal in magnitude to the size of the fixed cost.

      For some companies, costs do not depend on the number of items sold.
      For example,
      a city bus company with a fixed schedule has the same costs no matter how many people ride the buses.
      In such a situation, profit is maximized by maximizing revenue.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          At a price of $80 for a half-day trip,
          a white-water rafting company attracts 300 customers.
          Every $5 decrease in price attracts an additional 30 customers.
          How can we find the price that will maximize the revenue?
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to find revenue <m>R=pq</m>,
          we must first find the demand equation,
          meaning the equation relating price to demand.
          If price, <m>p</m>, is 80, the number of trips sold, <m>q</m>, is 300.
          If <m>p</m> is 75, then <m>q</m> is 330, and so on.
          Because demand changes by a constant (30 people) for every $5 drop in price,
          <m>q</m> is a linear function of <m>p</m>.
          Then
          <me>
            \text{ Slope }  = \frac{300-330}{80-75} = -\frac{30}{5} = -6\text{ people/dollar }
          </me>,
          so the demand equation is <m>q=-6p+b</m>.
          Since <m>p=80</m> when <m>q=300</m>,
          we have (using the point-slope equation)
          <me>
            q = -6(p-80)+300
          </me>
          <me>
            q= -6p+780
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The demand equation is <m>q=-6p+780</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since revenue <m>R=pq</m>, revenue as a function of price is
          <me>
            R(p) = p(-6p+780) = -6p^2+780p
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the maximum of the revenue function, we differentiate:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}R'(p) \amp = -12p+780 = 0\\ p \amp = \frac{780}{12} = 65. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a single critical point on the domain <m>p\geq 0</m> of <m>R(p)</m>,
          so as long as we verify that the critical point is a local maximum,
          it must be the global maximum by the Single Critical Point Theorem.
          Using the second derivative test, we calculate
          <me>
            R''(p) = -12
          </me>
          and so in particular,
          <me>
            R''(65) = -12
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tells us that <m>R(p)</m> is concave down at the critical point of <m>p=65</m>,
          and so <m>p=65</m> is the location of a local maximum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the maximum revenue is achieved when the price is $65.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    surge function, drug concentration curve, minimum effective concentration, onset, termination; supply curve, demand curve, marginal cost, marginal revenue.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Surge functions
      <m>y=ate^{-bt}</m> have the same basic shape,
      and the location of the maximum value is determined by the parameter <m>b</m>.
      Adding supply and demand to the ideas of cost, revenue,
      and profit,
      we can model revenue and profit relative to either the quantity of an item or the price of an item.
      Marginal is another word for "derivative of," and refers to the instantaneous change of either the cost,
      revenue, or profit function.
    </p>
    <p>
