      In this section,
      we develop formulas for differentiating the trigonometric functions.
      Because circular functions have periodic oscillating behavior,
      and their slopes also have periodic oscillating behavior,
      it would make sense if the derivatives of circular functions were also circular functions.

      We have already seen that the sine and cosine functions have many different relationships,
      leading to numerous identities.
      Now, we see that they are even further linked through calculus.
      The theorem below shows that the derivative of each involves the other:

      the orange tangent line at

        Notice that we have not actually <em>proven</em>
        the derivative rules for the sine and cosine functions.
        Doing so uses the limit definition of the derivative along with two difficult limits that we cannot yet compute;
        they require what's called the Squeeze Theorem.
        If you are curious, you can find a rigorous proof

      We can now use these two derivative rules to calculate derivatives of more complicated expressions involving trigonometric functions.
      The first example uses some of our familiar derivative rules:
      the sum and constant multiple rules:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate the derivative of <m>h(x) = 3\cos x-4\sin x</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}[3\cos x-4\sin x]\\
          \amp = 3\frac{d}{dx}[\cos x]-4\frac{d}{dx}[\sin x]\\
          \amp = 3(-\sin x)-4(\cos x)\\
          \amp = -3\sin x-4\cos x
          \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      We can also find equations of tangent lines to functions involving trigonometric functions the same way that we are used to doing:
      by taking the derivative and plugging in the <m>x</m>-value to find the slope of the line,
      using the original function to find the <m>y</m>-value of the point,
      and then using point-slope form to write the equation:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the equation of the tangent line to
          <m>y=g(x) = x^2+2\cos x</m> at the point where <m>x=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The derivative of <m>g(x) = x^2+2\cos x</m> is
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}g'(x) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}[x^2]+2\frac{d}{dx}[\cos x]\\ \amp =2x+2(-\sin x) \\ \amp = 2x-2\sin x \end{aligned}
          </me>
          and so the slope of the tangent line at <m>x=\frac{\pi}{2}</m> is
          <me>
            g'\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 2\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)-2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \pi-2(1) = \pi-2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <m>y</m>-value at the point where <m>x=\frac{\pi}{2}</m> is
          <me>
            y=g\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2+2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi^2}{4}+2(0) = \frac{\pi^2}{4}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the equation of the tangent line has slope
          <m>m = \pi-2</m> and passes through the point <m>\left(\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi^2}{4}\right)</m>.
          Plugging these into <m>y = m(x-x_1)+y_1</m>, we get the equation
          <me>
            y =(\pi-2)\left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)+\frac{\pi^2}{4}
          </me>.
          This could probably be simplified, but it's not worth doing.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the exact slope of the tangent line to
          <m>y=f(x) = 2x+\dfrac{\sin x}{2}</m> at the point where <m>x=\frac{\pi}{6}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Remember that we still need to use the product, quotient,
      and chain rules when taking derivatives of trigonometric functions whenever the function in question involves multiplying,
      dividing, or composing functions
      (respectively).
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Recall that the notation <m>\sin^2 x</m> means that the quantity <m>\sin x</m> is being squared:
          <me>
            \sin^2x = (\sin x)^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the derivative of <m>h(x) = \sin^2 x</m> requires the use of the chain rule, and is
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\left[(\sin x)^2\right]\\ \amp = 2(\sin x)\frac{d}{dx}[\sin x]\\ \amp = 2(\sin x)(\cos x) \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x) = \sin(4x)</m> has an "inside" function of <m>4x</m>,
          and so we need to use the chain rule to take its derivative.
          The derivative of <m>f(x) = \sin(4x)</m> is
          <me>
            f'(x) = \cos(4x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}(4x) = \cos(4x)\cdot 4 = 4\cos(4x)
          </me>.
          Note that the "inside" function is still <m>4x</m>,
          and if we want to find the second derivative,
          we need to use the chain rule again.
          The second derivative is
          <me>
            f''(x) = 4(-\sin(4x)\cdot4) = -16\sin(4x)
          </me>.
          Note again that the "inside" function has not changed.
          We can keep going!
          The third derivative is
          <me>
            f'''(x) = -16(\cos(4x)\cdot 4) = -64\cos(4x)
          </me>
          and the fourth derivative is
          <me>
            f^{(4)}(x) = -64(-\sin(4x)\cdot 4) = 256\sin(4x)
          </me>.
          <em>What would the fifth derivative be?
          And the sixth?
          Seventh?
          Eighth?<fn>
          Did you spot the pattern?
          For each additional derivative,
          we multiply by another 4 from the chain rule,
          while the sines and cosines alternate and the sign changes with every other derivative.
          </fn></em>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Here is another example of using the chain rule to take the derivative,
      where subsequent derivatives are not as simple to take:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The derivative of <m>f(x) = \cos(x^3)</m> is
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}f'(x) \amp = -\sin(x^3)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}[x^3] \\ \amp = -\sin(x^3)\cdot(3x^2) \\ \amp = -3x^2\sin(x^3). \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to find the second derivative,
          we need the product rule since <m>-3x^2</m> and
          <m>\sin(x^3)</m> are two functions that are being multiplied:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}f''(x) \amp = -3x^2\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x^3)]+\sin(x^3)\frac{d}{dx}[-3x^2]\\ \amp = -3x^2(-\cos(x^3)\cdot(3x^2))+\sin(x^3)(-6x) \\ \amp = 9x^4\cos(x^3)-6x\sin(x^3). \end{aligned}
          </me>

      As always, please remember that one meaning of the derivative is the rate of change of a quantity modeled by a function.
      If we are using a trigonometric function to model a periodic quantity,
      then the derivative still describes the rate of change:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <m>P(t) = 24+8\sin t</m> represents a population of a particular kind of animal that lives on a small island,
          where <m>P</m> is measured in hundreds and <m>t</m> is measured in decades since January 1, 2010.
          What is the instantaneous rate of change of <m>P</m> on January 1, 2030?
          What are the units of this quantity?
          Write a sentence in everyday language that explains how the population is behaving at this point in time.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Note that <m>t=2</m> corresponds to January 1, 2030,
          because it is two decades after January 1, 2010.
          <me>
            P'(t) = 8\cos t
          </me>
          and so on January 1, 2030, the instantaneous rate of change of <m>P</m> is
          <me>
            P'(2) = 8\cos 2\approx -3.329
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The units for <m>P'(t)</m> are hundreds of animals per decade,
          so we see that the population is decreasing at a rate of about 3.329 hundred animals per decade.
          We can further interpret this to mean approximately 333 animals every ten years,
          or about 33.3 animals per year, on January 1, 2030.

    <title>Derivatives of the Other Trigonometric Functions</title>
    <p>
      Recall that we can define the four other trigonometric functions in terms of the sine and cosine functions:
      <me>
        \tan \theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} \qquad \cot\theta = \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}
      </me>
      <me>
        \sec\theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}\qquad \csc\theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we know the derivatives of the sine and cosine function,
      we can now develop rules for how to differentiate these other functions.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          we can use the quotient rule to take the derivative of the tangent function:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}(\tan x) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\right) \amp  \\ \amp = \frac{\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x)\cdot(\cos x) - (\sin x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}(\cos x)}{(\cos x)^2} \amp \leftarrow \text{ quotient rule } \\ \amp =\frac{(\cos x)(\cos x) - (\sin x)(-\sin x)}{\cos^2 x} \amp \leftarrow \text{ derivatives of } \sin x\text{ and } \cos x\\ \amp = \frac{\cos^2x+\sin^2x}{\cos^2 x} \amp  \leftarrow\text{ algebra } \\ \amp = \frac{1}{\cos^2x} \amp  \leftarrow\text{ Pythagorean Identity } \cos^2x+\sin^2x=1\\ \amp = \sec^2 x \amp  \leftarrow\text{ rewriting } \frac{1}{\cos x} = \sec x \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we see that
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}(\tan x) = \sec^2 x
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Similarly, we can use the chain rule to take the derivative of the secant function:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}(\sec x) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{1}{\cos x}\right] \amp  \leftarrow\text{ definition of } \sec x\\ \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\big[(\cos x)^{-1}\big] \amp  \leftarrow\text{ rewriting to use the chain rule } \\ \amp = -(\cos x)^{-2} \frac{d}{dx}[\cos x]\amp  \leftarrow\text{ chain rule } \\ \amp = -\frac{1}{\cos^2 x}(-\sin x) \amp \leftarrow\text{ algebra, derivative of } \sin x\\ \amp =\frac{\sin x}{\cos ^2x}\amp \leftarrow\text{ algebra } \\ \amp =\frac{1}{\cos x} \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\amp  \leftarrow\text{ algebra } \\ \amp = \sec x\tan x \amp   \leftarrow\text{ rewriting in terms of tangent and secant } \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>

      Note that in the last steps of both of the above calculations,
      we rewrite the derivatives in terms of tangent and secant.
      These are the typical forms of these derivatives as seen in any standard textbook,
      but there is nothing technically wrong with leaving them in terms of the sine and cosine functions.

      The following theorem summarizes the derivatives of tangent,
      cotangent, secant, and cosecant.
      Of course, you can use these derivatives without knowing how they are derived,
      but it is useful to know where they come from in case you are stranded on a desert island without your notes and need to do calculus with trigonometry in order to tell time by tracking the movement of the stars (for example):

      Note that each derivative is defined only where the original function is defined.
      For instance,
      <m>\tan x</m> is undefined where <m>\cos x = 0</m>,
      and likewise <m>\sec^2x</m> is undefined where <m>\cos x = 0</m>,
      namely <m>x=\frac{\pi}{2}+k\pi</m>,
      where <m>k</m> is any integer.

      Using <xref ref="thm_derivofsineandcosine">Theorems</xref>
      and <xref ref="thm_derivsofothertrigfunctions"></xref>,
      we can now take derivatives of any function involving the six trigonometric functions.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate the derivative of
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{\tan x}{x^3-2}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x) = \frac{\tan x}{x^3-2}</m> is a quotient of two functions.
          By the quotient rule and the rule of differentiating tangent, we have
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{\tan x}{x^3-2}\right) \amp = \frac{\frac{d}{dx}(\tan x)\cdot (x^3-2)-(\tan x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}(x^3-2)}{(x^3-2)^2}\\ \amp = \frac{(\sec^2x)(x^3-2)-(\tan x)(3x^2)}{(x^3-2)^2} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no particular use in simplifying any further,
          and so we will leave this derivative as it is.
          Note in particular that there are no common factors in the numerator and no cancellation can occur between numerator and denominator.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate the derivative of <m>g(x) = \csc(2x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This function is a composition of <m>g(u) = \csc(u)</m> with <m>u=2x</m>.
          Recall that
          <me>
            g'(u) = -\csc u\cot u
          </me>
          and so by the chain rule,
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}g'(x) \amp = -\csc(2x)\cot(2x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}(2x) \\ \amp = -\csc(2x)\cot(2x)\cdot 2  \\ \amp = -2\csc(2x)\cot(2x). \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that we have to include the <m>2x</m> in <em>both</em>
          factors of the derivative <m>g'(u) = -\csc u\cot u</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate the derivative of <m>h(x) = \sec^2 e^x</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let's first rewrite the function to better see its structure:
          <me>
            h(x) = \sec^2 e^x = \left(\sec(e^x)\right)^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we see that <m>h(x)</m> is a composition of three functions:
          the outer-most function is squaring,
          next is secant, and the inner-most function is <m>e^x</m>.
          Thus we need to apply the chain rule twice:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}(\sec^2 e^x) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\big[ \left(\sec(e^x)\right)^2\big] \amp  \leftarrow\text{ rewrite so compositions are clear } \\ \amp = 2(\sec(e^x))^{2-1}\cdot\frac{d}{dx}\left[\sec(e^x)\right] \amp  \leftarrow\text{ first application of the chain rule to } (\cdot)^2\\ \amp = 2(\sec e^x)\cdot\sec(e^x)\tan(e^x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^x\right] \amp  \leftarrow\text{ second application of the chain rule to } \sec(\cdot)\\ \amp = 2(\sec e^x)^2\tan e^x\cdot e^x\amp  \leftarrow\text{ derivative of } e^x\\ \amp = 2e^x\sec^2e^x\tan e^x \amp  \leftarrow\text{ rewriting without extra parentheses } \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following formulas were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    Derivatives of the six trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative of cosine is negative sine.
      We have to make sure to keep using all of the same derivative rules.
      The derivatives of the other trigonometric functions can be derived by rewriting them in terms of sine and cosine,
      but you can also just look these up when you need them
      (and hopefully remember them eventually).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      The derivative is the slope of the tangent line to a function at each point in the domain of the function.
      The domain of the derivative should match the domain of the original function
      (as long as the original function is differentiable on its domain).
      Derivatives also measure rates of change of quantities and units are still important.
