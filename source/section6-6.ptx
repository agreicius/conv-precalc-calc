  <subsection>
    <title>Defining <m>e</m> via Derivatives of Exponential Functions</title>
    <p>
      We have already made some observations about the derivatives of exponential functions
      <m>f(x) = b^x</m> without ever having calculated them:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            When <m>b>1</m>, because <m>b^x</m> models percent growth,
            <m>b^x</m> is always increasing,
            thus its derivative is always positive.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m>, because <m>b^x</m> models percent decay,
            <m>b^x</m> is always decreasing,
            thus its derivative is always negative.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Because it models percent change,<fn>
            The change in <m>b^x</m> depends on its size,
            so an increasing exponential function will increase faster as <m>b^x</m> grows,
            and a decreasing exponential function will decrease more slowly as <m>b^x</m> decays,
            both of which translate to a concave up shape.
            </fn> <m>b^x</m> is always concave up,
            regardless of whether it models exponential growth or decay,
            thus its second derivative is always positive.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>But how do we actually find a formula for the derivative of <m>f(x)=b^x</m>?</em>
      The power rule tells us that the derivative of <m>x^k</m> is <m>kx^{k-1}</m>,
      but this rule only works for power functions,
      where the <em>base</em> is the variable <m>x</m> and the
      <em>exponent</em> is a constant <m>k</m>.
      <em>It does not tell us how to differentiate an exponential function like <m>2^x</m> or <m>(1.07)^{3t}</m>,
      where the variable is in the exponent!!!</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine the derivative of an exponential function <m>f(x) = b^x</m>,
      we must return to the limit definition of the derivative:
      <me>
        f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's apply this definition to the function <m>f(x) = b^x</m>.
      Note that since the original limit has the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>,
      we anticipate needing to use some algebraic manipulation to evaluate the limit.
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{d}{dx}(b^x) \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{b^{x+h} - b^x}{h}\amp \leftarrow\amp  \text{ apply the definition } f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{b^{x}b^h - b^x}{h}\amp \leftarrow\amp  \text{ split up the exponent }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{b^{x}(b^h - 1)}{h}\amp \leftarrow\amp  \text{ factor out } b^x</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \left(\lim_{h\to 0}\ b^x\cdot \frac{b^h - 1}{h}\right)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we have simplified as much as possible,
      this is a limit that we do not yet know how to calculate.
      The expression
      <me>
        \frac{b^h - 1}{h}
      </me>
      will still evaluate to <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> as <m>h\to 0</m> and so is still indeterminate.
      Let's numerically estimate
      (using a table)
      a few values of this expression as <m>h\to0</m> to see if we can anticipate what it will be equal to:

      <em>What is the significance of these limits?</em>
      Interpreting them visually will give us some clue as to how to proceed.
      Note that, because <m>b^0 = 1</m>, the quantity
      <me>
        f'(0) =  \left(\lim_{h\to 0}\ b^0\cdot \frac{b^h - 1}{h}\right) =  \left(\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{b^h - 1}{h}\right)
      </me>
      represents the slope <m>f'(0)</m> of the tangent line to
      <m>f(x) = b^x</m> at the point <m>(0,1)</m>.
      We can see these tangent lines visualized for <m>b=2</m> and <m>b=3</m> in the pictures below:
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_BACPage42a">

      \caption{Slopes of tangent lines to <m>2^x</m> and <m>3^x</m> at <m>x=0</m>. One is slightly less than 1 while the other is slightly greater than 1.}
    </figure>
    <p>
      Wouldn't it be fabulous if the entire expression
      <me>
        \frac{b^h-1}{h}
      </me>
      would just go away?? The amazing thing in this case is that yes, it can.
      There is a special number, called <m>e</m>,
      defined specifically so that the slope of the tangent line to
      <m>f(x) = e^x</m> at the point <m>(0,1)</m> is exactly 1:
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_BACPage42c">
      <caption>The tangent line of <m>f(x) = e^x</m> at <m>x=0</m> has slope exactly 1.</caption>
      <image width="37%" source="BACPage42c.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In terms of the limit we have been trying to evaluate,
      we have defined this special number <m>e</m> precisely so that the limit is equal to 1:
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def_limitdefe">
      <title>A Characterization of the Number $e$</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The number <m>e</m> satisfies the following limit statement:
          <me>
            \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{e^h-1}{h} = 1
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Therefore, when <m>b=e</m>,
      the limit as <m>h\to 0</m> of
      <m>\frac{b^h-1}{h}</m> in our derivative calculation becomes 1 and "disappears," hence the derivative of the exponential function <m>f(x) = e^x</m> is:
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{e^{x+h} - e^x}{h}\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \vdots\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = e^x\left(\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{e^h - 1}{h}\right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = e^x(1) \amp \leftarrow\amp \text{ since } \ds\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{e^h-1}{h} = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =e^x</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have just shown that the function
      <m>f(x) = e^x</m> is its own derivative!
      As illustrated in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage363">Figure</xref> below,
      <m>y=e^x</m> is its own associated slope function,
      meaning that <m>y=e^x</m> grows in such a way that its height is exactly how fast its height is increasing.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_TaalmanPage363">
      <caption>Since <m>\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x</m>, the slope of <m>e^x</m> is equal to the height of <m>e^x</m> at each point.</caption>
      <image width="92.5%" source="TaalmanPage363.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Other exponential functions of the form <m>b^x</m> have graphs similar to the graph of <m>e^x</m>,
      but only <m>e^x</m> is scaled in exactly the right way to be its own derivative.
      The exponential function <m>e^x</m> is called the
      <em>natural exponential function</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the point of view of derivatives,
      the base <m>e</m> is <em>extremely</em> special.
      The number <m>e</m> (named in homage to the great Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler (1707-1783)) is complicated to define.
      Like <m>\pi</m>,
      <m>e</m> is an irrational number that cannot be represented exactly by a ratio of integers and whose decimal expansion never repeats.
      Because of our numerical estimates in <xref ref="tab_limitof2h">Table</xref>
      and <xref ref="tab_limitof3h">Table</xref>,
      we know that <m>e</m> must be between <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> in order for the slope of the tangent line to <m>e^x</m> at <m>x=0</m> to be 1.
      Here is another definition for the number <m>e</m>,
      but showing that it is equivalent to <xref ref="def_limitdefe">Definition</xref>
      requires advanced mathematics that is beyond the scope of this course.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <title>The natural base $e$</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The number <m>e</m> is the infinite sum
          <me>
            e = 1+\frac{1}{1!}+\frac{2}{2!}+\frac{3}{3!}+\ldots
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          From this, <m>e\approx 2.718\ldots</m>.

      However, we can use Desmos to estimate <m>e</m> for ourselves.

      In order to take derivatives of an arbitrary exponential function <m>f(x) = Ab^x</m>,
      we will need to know that every exponential function can be written so that its base is the number <m>e</m>.
      In order to do this, we note that
      <me>
        b^x = e^{(\log_e b) x}
      </me>
      because of the cancellation properties of logarithms (part (f) of <xref ref="thm_relationshipsoflogsandexp">Theorem</xref>).
      Using a base of <m>e</m> in a logarithm is so common that there is a special name and notation for such logarithmic functions:
      the base-<m>e</m> logarithmic function is the
      <em>natural logarithmic function</em>
      \fbox{<m>\log_e x = \ln x</m>.}

      We can still use all of our old derivative rules,
      including the product, quotient, and chain rules.
      The chain rule looks very different than we are used to,
      and so we state it below with this new possible "outside" function of <m>b^x</m>:
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>The chain rule for exponential functions</title>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx}\left(e^{g(x)}\right) = g'(x)e^{g(x)}
        </me>
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx}\left(b^{g(x)}\right) = (\ln b)g'(x)b^{g(x)}
        </me>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The "outside" function is <m>f(u) = e^u</m>,
        and the "inside" function is <m>u=g(x)</m>,
        so that <m>e^{g(x)} = f(g(x))</m>.
        The chain rule tells us that
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x))g'(x)
        </me>
        and in this case we have
        <me>
          f'(u) = e^u
        </me>.
        Combining these,
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}\left(e^{g(x)}\right) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\left(f(g(x))\right)\\ \amp =f'(g(x))g'(x)\\ \amp = e^{g(x)} g'(x) \amp \amp  \text{ since } f'(u) = e^u \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, if <m>f(x) = b^x</m>,
        then <m>f'(x) = (\ln b)b^x</m> and so
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}\left(b^{g(x)}\right) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\left(f(g(x))\right)\\ \amp =f'(g(x))g'(x)\\ \amp = (\ln b)b^{g(x)} g'(x) \amp \amp  \text{ since } f'(u) = (\ln b)b^u \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
    </proof>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A special case of the chain rule is when we have a function of the form <m>f(x) = e^{kx}</m>.
          Then if <m>g(x) = kx</m> is the "inside" function in the exponent,
          <m>g'(x) = k</m> and so
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(e^{kx}\right)  = ke^{kx}
          </me>

          For another example, we have

          It's not required,
          but it is customary to rewrite products with the exponential function to the far right.
          This makes them less ambiguous if our handwriting gets sloppy and we can't tell whether the thing we are multiplying by is in the exponent or not.

          much easier.

          There are two possible ways to approach this problem.
          The first is to recognize that the exponential function is on the
          <em>inside</em> of a composition,
          since <m>e^x</m> appears inside the square root.
          Thus we have
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{d}{dx}(3\sqrt{e^x}-x^2) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}(3(e^x)^{1/2}-x^2) \amp \leftarrow\amp \text{ rewrite so differentiation will be easier }</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(e^x)^{-1/2}(e^x)-2x \amp \leftarrow \amp \text{ don't forget the chain rule! }</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{3}{2}e^x(e^x)^{-1/2}-2x \amp \leftarrow\amp \text{ some algebra }</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We could simplify the answer further,
          but there's no need to do that right now.
          Here is another, arguably better way to approach this computation:
          we could have saved ourselves some differentiation work by doing some algebra first,
          as is often the case.
          In particular,
          we can combine the exponent of the exponential function with the square root:
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{d}{dx}(3\sqrt{e^x}-x^2) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}(3(e^x)^{1/2}-x^2) \amp \leftarrow \amp  \text{ rewrite so differentiation will be easier }</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac{d}{dx}(3e^{x/2}-x^2) \amp \leftarrow\amp \text{ combine exponents of \(e\) }</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)e^{x/2}-2x\amp \leftarrow\amp \text{ differentiation is easier now }</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer is equivalent to the answer we got in the first calculation.
          (Do some algebra to see why.)
          Notice that the differentiation steps used in the second calculation were <em>easier</em>
          than the differentiation steps used in the first calculation.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    The natural base <m>e</m>, the natural exponential function <m>e^x</m>, the natural logarithmic function <m>\ln x = \log_e x</m>
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> <m>e</m> is a special number defined so that the slope of the tangent line to
      <m>f(x) = e^x</m> at <m>x=0</m> is 1 and the change of
      <m>f(x) = e^x</m> is exactly equal to <m>e^x</m>,
      meaning <m>\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x</m>.
      Every exponential function can be rewritten in terms of the base of <m>e</m>,
      and from this we see <m>\frac{d}{dx}(b^x) = (\ln b)b^x</m>.
      The chain rule looks strange when combined with exponential functions and is worth paying special attention to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      Factoring exponential functions out of a derivative can be a useful simplification.
