    <title>Motivational Scenario</title>
    <p>
      I'm melting sugar into caramel while watching the latest episode of The Great British Baking Show on Netflix.
      It's taking forever for my stove to come up to temperature and I need to be careful:
      sugar caramelizes at 340 degrees Fahrenheit (170 degrees Celsius) and will quickly start to burn if it gets too hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm momentarily transfixed by Abdul's stunning parrot mask biscuit showstopper.
      Oh no!
      My sugar has overheated and burned.
      I'm so annoyed with myself.
      If I had paid more attention, I could have caught the moment it reached the right temperature and prevented this disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several (mathematical) assumptions that feed into my frustration.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The temperature of the sugar could not have jumped over <m>340^\circ</m>F.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There is a point in time at which the temperature was exactly <m>340^\circ</m>F.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            That time must have been while I was distracted because the sugar went from too cool to too hot when I wasn't looking.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these assumptions
      (and my resulting frustration)
      are encapsulated by the Intermediate Value Theorem,
      which states that continuous functions,
      such as temperature, cannot skip values,
      such as <m>340^\circ</m>F.

    <title>The Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we examine an important consequence of continuity that extends beyond our desire to describe a single value of a function.
      If <m>f</m> is continuous between two values <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m>,
      then the corresponding values of <m>f(x)</m> go through every possible intermediate value between the <m>y</m>-values <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>.
      This is intuitively obvious if we think of continuous functions as having
      <q>unbroken</q>
      graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      consider the function <m>f</m> in the figure that follows.
      The function is equal to every {\t intermediate} value <m>y=K</m> between <m>y=f(a)</m> and <m>y=f(b)</m>:
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_taalmanpage129c">
      <caption>The continuous function <m>f(x)</m> has height <m>y=K</m> at <m>x=c</m>.</caption>
      <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage129c.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In general, passing through all such "intermediate values" is a property that holds for every function that is continuous on a closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>:
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>The Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>f</m> is a continuous function on a closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> such that
          <m>f(a)\neq f(b)</m> and <m>K</m> is any <m>y</m>-value strictly between <m>y=f(a)</m> and <m>y=f(b)</m>.
          Then there exists at least one <m>x</m>-value <m>c</m> between <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m> such that <m>f(c)=K</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This important consequence of continuity may seem obvious,
      but in fact it relies on a subtle mathematical property of the real numbers called the
      <em>Least Upper Bound Axiom.</em>
      Properly explaining why the Intermediate Value Theorem is true is outside of the scope of this book.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Intermediate Value Theorem,
      the hypothesis that <m>f</m> be continuous on a closed interval is essential.
      If <m>f</m> either fails to be continuous on the interior of the interval or fails to be continuous at a closed endpoint,
      then the conclusion of this theorem does not necessarily hold.
      For example,
      the function below fails to be continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and also fails to satisfy the conclusion of the Intermediate Value Theorem for the pictured value of <m>K</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this theorem has two different parts:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <em>hypothesis</em> of the theorem are the conditions that need to be met in order to apply the theorem.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <em>conclusion</em> of the theorem is what the theorem tells us to be true,
            given that the conditions in the hypothesis are met.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>hypotheses</em> of the Intermediate Value Theorem are
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f</m> must be continuous on the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(a)\neq f(b)</m>, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>K</m> must be a <m>y</m>-value strictly between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>conclusion</em> of the Intermediate Value Theorem is
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            that there is at least one value <m>x=c</m> that is between <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m> such that <m>f(c)=K</m>,
            meaning that the function <m>f</m> has height <m>y=K</m> <em>somewhere</em>
            on the interval from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_IVTintroex">
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can use the Intermediate Value Theorem to show that
          <me>
            x^4+x=3
          </me>
          has a solution for some <m>x</m>-value between <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, define the function <m>f(x) = x^4+x</m>.
          We are given <m>x</m>-values <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=2</m>,
          so in the IVT, we are using <m>a=1</m> and <m>b=2</m>.
          We want to know that <m>f(x) = 3</m>,
          so in the IVT we are using <m>K=3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's check that the hypotheses of the IVT are true:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f</m> is algebraic with domain <m>\mathbb{R}</m>,
                hence <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[1,2]</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f(1) = (1)^4+1 = 2</m> and
                <m>f(2) = (2)^4+2 = 18</m>, so <m>f(1)\neq f(2)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>K=3</m> is strictly between
                <m>f(1) = 2</m> and <m>f(2) = 18</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the hypotheses are all met,
          we may use the conclusion:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is a value of <m>x=c</m> between <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=2</m> such that
                <me>
                  \begin{aligned}f(c) \amp = 3\\ c^4+c \amp = 3 \end{aligned}
                </me>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we know that <m>x=c</m> is a solution to the equation <m>x^4+x=3</m> and that <m>1\lt c\lt 2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do we know the precise value of <m>c</m>?
          No, we do not.
          We can <em>guess</em> that <m>x=c</m> is fairly close to <m>x=1</m>,
          since <m>f(1)=2</m> is close to <m>K=3</m> (especially compared to <m>f(2) = 18</m>),
          but we don't know that for a fact.
          It's also possible that there is more than one solution to the equation <m>x^4+x=3</m> between <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
          The IVT does not specify how many values of <m>c</m> there are,
          just that at least one exists.

      <title>A real-world illustration of the Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>w(t)</m> that describes a particular person's weight at <m>t</m> years of age between the ages of 18 and 45.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weight function <m>w(t)</m> should be continuous on <m>[18,45]</m> because a person's weight changes continuously over time and cannot jump from one value to another.
          (We are assuming typical circumstances,
          so that a person does not get a serious haircut, lose a limb,
          or somehow otherwise get their weight to change drastically in an instant.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that for every weight <m>K</m> between <m>w(18)</m> and <m>w(45)</m>,
          there is some time <m>c</m> between 18 and 45 for which <m>w(c) = K</m>.
          For example, if the person weighed
          <m>w(18)=130</m> pounds at age 18 and <m>w(45)=163</m> pounds at age 45,
          then there must be some age between 18 and 45 at which the person weighed, say,
          exactly 144 pounds.
          In fact, we know that the person must have weighed all of the weights between 130 and 163 pounds,
          at least once between ages 18 and 45.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also entirely possible that the person may have weighed exactly 144 pounds multiple times between ages 18 and 45,
          and we don't know exactly when the person weighed exactly 144 pounds from the theorem.

      <title>Applying the Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x) = x^3-3x+1</m> is continuous everywhere as we saw in <xref ref="thm_contofalgebraicfunctions">Theorem</xref>.
          We use the Intermediate Value Theorem to conclude that there is some point <m>c</m> for which <m>f(c)=2</m>,
          even though we cannot solve the equation <m>x^3-3x+1=2</m> by hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          To show that there is some <m>c</m> with <m>f(c)=2</m>,
          we need to find values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> such that <m>K=2</m> is between <m>y=f(a)</m> and <m>y=f(b)</m>,
          and apply the Intermediate Value Theorem.
          By trial and error, we can find such values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
          by testing different value of <m>f(x)</m> until we find one that is less than and one that is greater than <m>2</m>.
          For example,
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}f(0)\amp =0^3-3(0)+1 = 1\lt 2,\\ f(2)\amp =2^3-3(2)+1 = 3>2. \end{aligned}

          by the Intermediate Value Theorem there is some value <m>c</m> between <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m> for which <m>f(c)=2</m>.
          Note that the Intermediate Value Theorem doesn't tell us where <m>c</m> is,
          only that such a <m>c</m> exists somewhere in the interval <m>(0,2)</m>.

    <title>Where a Function Can Change Sign</title>
    <p>
      Dear reader,
      you have been using the Intermediate Value Theorem for some time now without knowing it!
      An extremely useful special case of the Intermediate Value Theorem is the case when we consider the intermediate value <m>K=0</m>.
      In this case,
      the Intermediate Value Theorem says that if <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m> have opposite signs
      (one positive, one negative),
      then there exists at least one <m>x=c</m> between <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m> where <m>f(c)=0</m>,
      meaning that <m>x=c</m> is a zero of <m>f(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said another way:
      if a function is going to switch from positive to negative or vice versa,
      it either has to pass through the <m>x</m>-axis somewhere
      (where <m>y=0</m>),
      or else it has to jump over it somehow,
      meaning it is discontinuous.
      The IVT forces the function to cross the <m>x</m>-axis at a specific value <m>x=c</m> in order to change signs,
      unless the function is discontinuous,
      in which case the IVT does not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use this special application of the IVT every time we solve an inequality by checking signs between zeros and discontinuities!

        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> can change sign
          (from positive to negative or vice versa)
          at a point <m>x=c</m> only if <m>f(x)</m> is zero, undefined,

      The graph in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage130a" autoname="yes"/> at the left shows a function <m>f</m> that is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      and changes sign only at its zeros <m>c_1, c_2</m>, and <m>c_3</m>.
      The graph in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage130b" autoname="yes"/> at the right is discontinuous somewhere in <m>[a,b]</m> and therefore can change sign as we move from left to right without ever crossing the <m>y</m>-axis.

          Explain in your own words why a function <m>f</m> can change sign at <m>x=c</m> only if <m>f(x)</m> is zero,
          undefined,
          or discontinuous at <m>x=c</m>.
          (Imagine that you are explaining this to one of your classmates while working at the board during class.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Determine the intervals on which the function
          <me>
            f(x) = \begin{cases}x+1,\amp  \text{ if }  x\lt -2\\ (x+1)^2,\amp  \text{ if }  -2\leq x\leq 1\\ 2-x,\amp  \text{ if }  x>1 \end{cases}
          </me>
          is positive and negative.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The piecewise-defined function <m>f</m> can be discontinuous only at its break points <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
          We check whether the left and right limits at each point are the same.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                At <m>x=-2</m>,
                we use the piece <m>x+1</m> to the left and the piece <m>(x+1)^2</m> to the right:
                <me>
                  \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to -2^-}f(x) \amp = \lim_{x\to -2^-}x+1 = -2+1 = -1\\ \lim_{x\to -2^+}f(x) \amp =\lim_{x\to -2^+}(x+1)^2 = (-2+1)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 \end{aligned}
                </me>
                The left and right limits are different,
                so the function is discontinuous at <m>x=-2</m>; it has a jump.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                At <m>x=1</m> we use the piece <m>(x+1)^2</m> to the left and the piece <m>2-x</m> to the right:
                <me>
                  \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to 1^-}f(x) \amp = \lim_{x\to 1^-}(x+1)^2 = (1+1)^2 = (2)^2 = 4\\ \lim_{x\to 1^+}f(x) \amp =\lim_{x\to 1^+}2-x = 2-1 = 1 \end{aligned}
                </me>
                The left and right limits are different,
                so the function is discontinuous at <m>x=1</m>; this is also a jump.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>f(x)</m> is discontinuous at <m>x=-2,1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, let's check whether <m>f(x)</m> is ever equal to zero.
          We must look at each piece of the function separately,
          and remember what <m>x</m>-values we use for each piece.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Its first piece, <m>x+1</m> is equal to zero when <m>x=-1</m>,
                which is not on the interval <m>x\lt -2</m> where that piece is used.
                So that part of the function is never equal to zero.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The second piece <m>(x+1)^2</m> is zero at <m>x=-1</m>.
                That is within the interval
                <m>-2\leq x\leq 1</m> on which the piece is used,
                so the function is equal to zero at <m>x=-1</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The third piece <m>2-x</m> is zero when <m>x=2</m>.
                That is on the interval <m>x>1</m> where that piece is used,
                so the function is also equal to zero at <m>x=2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>f(x)</m> is equal to zero at <m>x=-1, 2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="thm_changesign">Theorem</xref>
          the function <m>f</m> can change sign only at the zeros,
          <m>x=-1, 2</m>, and discontinuities, <m>x=-2,1</m>.
          We put these points on a number line,
          marking 0 for zeros and <sc>DC</sc> for discontinuities,
          then check the sign of <m>f</m> one time between each of these points:

        <p>
          Lastly, recall that <m>f(x)</m> is defined at each of the discontinuities.
          <m>f(-2) = 1</m> and <m>f(1) = 4</m>,
          so <m>f(x)</m> is positive at both of these endpoints.
          Remember that <m>0</m> is neither positive nor negative.
          Thus reading from the signs on the number line,
          we see that <m>f(x)</m> is positive between <m>-2</m> and <m>-1</m>,
          including at <m>-2</m>,
          and also between <m>-1</m> and <m>2</m>,
          where at <m>x=1</m> the function remains positive.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms and theorems were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    the Intermediate Value Theorem, hypothesis, conclusion.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The hypotheses of a theorem must be true in order to apply the conclusion of the theorem,
      so we must always check the hypotheses before using a theorem.
      The Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that a continuous function on a closed interval must be equal to all of its intermediate <m>y</m>-values at some point
      (or multiple points).
      Because of the IVT, a function can only change sign at zeros or discontinuities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      We can apply the IVT to find intervals of <m>x</m>-values on which a continuous function must be equal to a particular value <m>y=K</m>,
      provided that we know the function is equal to values that are larger and smaller than <m>K</m>.
