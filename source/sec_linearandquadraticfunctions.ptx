    <title>Definitions of linear and quadratic functions</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Linear and quadratic functions are important for modeling relationships between many different quantities.
        For example, in statistics,
        the method of Linear Regression seeks to find a line that best describes the relationship between quantities that appear to change at a constant rate relative to each other.
        Quadratic functions are used to model the height of an object falling under the force of gravity.
        We will explore several models that use linear and quadratic functions in <xref ref="sec_linearandquadraticmodeling" autoname="yes"/> after we develop our mathematical understanding of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We begin with the mathematical definitions of linear and quadratic functions.
        Recall that a <em>mathematical definition</em>
        is "used to give a precise meaning to a new term,
        by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what a mathematical term is and is not."<fn>

        accessed August 4, 2022.
        </fn> Thus the definitions below give us the precise meaning of a linear or quadratic function.
        Remember that we generally need a few examples to make sense of definitions,
        and these follow below each of the definitions.

            A <em>linear function</em> is a function that can be written in the form
            <m>f(x) = mx+b</m> for some real numbers <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>.
            Alternately, a linear function can be written as a
            <em>linear equation</em> <m>y=mx+b</m>,
            where <m>y</m> is a dependent variable of the independent variable <m>x</m>.

        <title>Examples of linear functions</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Below are three examples of linear functions.
            <ol marker="labeltextbfalph">
              <li>
                <p>
                  The equation
                  <me>
                    y=3x+1
                  </me>
                  defines <m>y</m> as a linear function of <m>x</m>,
                  taking <m>m=3</m> and <m>b=1</m> in Definition <xref ref="def_linearfunction" autoname="yes"/>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The equation
                  <me>
                    y=x
                  </me>
                  also defines <m>y</m> as a linear function of <m>x</m> if we rewrite it as
                  <me>
                    y=1\cdot x+0
                  </me>
                  so that we see that we must take <m>m=1</m> and <m>b=0</m>.
                  This function, <m>f(x) = x</m> is a special function,
                  called the <em>identity function</em>,
                  where the output and input are the same.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The equation
                  <me>
                    y=1.2
                  </me>
                  is also a linear equation, so defines <m>y</m> as a linear function
                  (the independent variable isn't specified,
                  though we can infer it to be <m>x</m>).
                  To see this, rewrite it as
                  <me>
                    y=0\cdot x+1.2
                  </me>
                  so that we can see that we must take <m>m=0</m> and <m>b=1.2</m>.
                  <m>f(x)=1.2</m> is an example of a
                  <em>constant function</em>,
                  which is a function of the form <m>f(x) = b</m>.
                  For any input, the output is always <m>b</m>,
                  meaning the output is a constant number.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>
        An important detail of the above definition is that a linear function <em>can</em>
        be rewritten in the form <m>f(x)=mx+b</m>;
        it may not look like that originally.
      </p>
      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Rewrite
            <me>
              y=\frac{3x+1}{2},  \text{ and }   2y-1=6x
            </me>
            in the form <m>y=mx+b</m> and identify <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>.
            These are two more examples of linear functions.
          </p>

        <title>Quadratic Function</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A <em>quadratic function</em> is one that may be written in the form
            <me>
              f(x)=ax^2+bx+c
            </me>,
            where <m>a, b</m>, and <m>c</m> are real numbers with <m>a\neq 0</m>.
            Alternately, a quadratic function can be written as a
            <em>quadratic equation</em>
            <me>
              y=ax^2+bx+c
            </me>,
            where <m>y</m> is a dependent variable of the independent variable <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <p>
        Similar to linear functions,
        quadratic functions <em>can</em>
        be written in the form <m>f(x) = ax^2+bx+c</m> but do not need to begin that way.
      </p>
      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Rewrite each of the expressions below in the form
            <me>
              y=ax^2+bx+c
            </me>
            and identify <m>a, b</m>, and <m>c</m>.
            These are examples of quadratic functions.

      <title>Parameters</title>
      <p>
        It is important to note that when we write an expression like
        <m>f(x) = mx+b</m> or <m>f(x) = ax^2+bx+c</m>,
        only <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are variables.
        The extra letters <m>a, b, c</m>,
        and <m>m</m> that are not variables are called
        <em>parameters</em> of the function.
        How should you think about these parameters and what they represent?
      </p>
      <p>
        While the word <em>parameter</em> may be new to you,
        the concept is probably not so unfamiliar.
        We can think of a <em>parameter</em>
        as a "dial" on the function machine.
        Setting the dials to different values creates different functions.<fn>

        <title>Parameters of Linear Functions</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the linear function:
            <me>
              y = mx + b
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Here <m>x</m> is the independent variable and <m>y</m> is the dependent variable.
            The letters <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> are parameters of the linear equation.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If we choose a specific value of <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> ("set the dials"), we get a specific line.
                  For example,
                  if <m>m = 3</m> and <m>b = -7</m> we get the linear function <m>y = 3x - 7</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  When we change the dials, we get a different line.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>
        When we have a <em>function with parameters</em>,
        we can think of this function representing a whole family of functions,
        one for each combination of parameter values.

        <xref ref="tab_funcprops1" autoname="yes"/> uses <m>x</m> as the independent variable and <m>y</m> as the dependent variable.

    <p>
      There are similar definitions for negative, decreasing,
      and concave down behavior, as well as local and global minima.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that we describe <em>extrema</em>
      (maxima and minima)
      by <em>where</em> on the <m>x</m>-axis they occur,
      since we can always find the corresponding <m>y</m>-values from these <m>x</m>-values.
      The concept of "near" in the description of a local maximum will be made more precise in Chapters 2 and 3.
      Inflection points and concavity cannot be precisely defined until we learn about
      <em>derivatives</em> in Chapter 3.
      In that chapter we will also learn ways for algebraically calculating the locations of extrema and inflection points.
      For now we present them just to set terminology and to familiarize ourselves with various types of function behavior;
      we will have to be content with examining such things graphically.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <m>x</m>-intercepts of
          <m>f(x) = 1-3x</m> are where <m>f(x) = 0</m>,
          so at the values of <m>x</m> with <m>1-3x=0</m>.
          Solving for <m>x</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}1-3x \amp = 0\\ 1 \amp =3x\\ \frac{1}{3} \amp =x \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we see that <m>f(x) = 1-3x</m> has an <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x=\frac{1}{3}</m>.
        </p>

          <url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/uo5qirntxg">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/uo5qirntxg</url>
          and set the sliders to <m>m=-3, b=1</m>.
          From this we see that <m>f(x)</m> is positive
          (above the <m>x</m>-axis)
          for <m>x\lt \frac{1}{3}</m> and negative
          (below the <m>x</m>-axis)
          for <m>x>\frac{1}{3}</m>.
          The graph also tells us that <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing for <m>x\in\mathbb{R}</m>,
          meaning for all values of <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The graph of <m>f(x)</m> has no local or global maxima or minima.
          This is true of all linear functions:
          none of them have any local or global extrema.
          Similarly, since the graphs of linear functions are lines,
          they are neither concave up nor concave down and do not have any inflection points.

      <title>Finding a "good" graphing window</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Since we are using graphs to determine the properties of functions
          (for now),
          we should be especially careful that we can create a "good" graph of a function,
          meaning a graph that captures all of the key features and properties of the graph.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, we demonstrate finding a "good" graphing window for the graph of the function
          <me>
            f(x) = x^3-6x^2-x+6
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three graphs that follow show <m>y=f(x)</m> in various graphing windows.
          Each of these windows is "bad" in the sense that the true behavior of the graph of <m>f</m> is not represented.

        </figure>
        <p>
          A "good" window
          (if one exists)
          is a window in which the local behavior of the graph of <m>f</m> is clear and the global behavior is accurately represented
          (the "ends" of the graph keep going in the direction indicated).
          The following figure shows the graph of <m>f</m> in a "good" window:

        </figure>
        <p>
          For now we will use trial and error to find an effective graphing window.
          Later, we will learn algebraic methods for determining all of these properties.

      A line in the plane is completely described by its slope <m>m</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>b</m>.

      We can also describe a line in the plane with its slope and the coordinates of any point on the line,
      or with the coordinates of any two points on the line.<fn>
      This last is how Euclid's Elements begin to develop geometry.
      Book I Postulate 1 states that given any two points,

    <p>
      There is an advantage to slope-intercept form in that we can tell from looking at any two functions in that form whether they represent the same line.
      However, the other forms are sometimes easier to use based on our given information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's explore the point-slope and two-point forms a bit more.
      The slope <m>m</m> of a line can be interpreted as how much the line "rises"
      (increases or decreases)
      given a "run" of one unit increase in <m>x</m>.
      Thus the slope can be calculated by the formula \fbox{<m>m =\frac{\text{ rise } }{\text{ run } }=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>} for any two points
      <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m> on the line.
      From this we see that the two-point form of the equation of a line is the same as the point-slope form,
      as long as we calculate the slope <m>m</m> from the two points ahead of time.
      Note that when we do that,
      we may use either point <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> or
      <m>(x_2,y_2)</m> to determine the equation,
      but we must stick with one or the other.

          we can graph them with a graphing utility
          (such as Desmos).
          In particular, let's graph the lines <m>y=-3x+6</m> (red) and
          <m>y=\frac{1}{3}x+1</m> (green) in part c to make sure they appear to be perpendicular:

        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that the scales on the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes are the same,
          so the lines correctly appear as perpendicular.
          Additionally,
          we can see that the point <m>(2,0)</m> is on the line <m>y=-3x+6</m>.

    <title>Finding <m>x</m>-intercepts of Quadratic Functions</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we develop algebraic methods for finding the <m>x</m>-intercepts of quadratic functions.
      This is where the graph of the function crosses the <m>x</m>-axis.
      As we can see in <xref ref="fig_quadratics">Figure</xref>,
      by shifting the graph of a quadratic function vertically,
      we can make its graph cross the <m>x</m>-axis 0 times
      (as in the graph labeled <m>p</m>),
      exactly 1 time ( as in the graph labeled <m>q</m>), or twice
      (as in the graph labeled <m>r</m>).
      These points are the <m>x</m>-intercepts,
      sometimes referred to as <em>zeros</em> of the graph,
      because these are the points where the quadratic function is equal to 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we want to find the zeros of a quadratic equation,
      we must find the values of <m>x</m> that make the quadratic function <m>f(x) = ax^2+bx+c</m> equal to zero,
      meaning we must solve solve the
      <em>quadratic equation</em>
      <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> for the variable <m>x</m>.
      Some quadratic equations can be solved easily by <em>factoring</em>
      the quadratic expression <m>ax^2+bx+c</m>.
      To factor an algebraic expression,
      you write that expression as a product of simpler expressions.
      There are a few different common methods for factoring that we will discuss here:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_factoring1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the expression <m>3x^2-6x</m> can be factored by recognizing that both terms share common factors of 3 and <m>x</m> that can be un-distributed from the expression:
          <me>
            3x^2-6x = 3x\cdot x-3x\cdot 2 = 3x(x-2)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can think of this factoring as "reverse distributing."
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Some quadratic expressions can be factored by doing the "FOIL" ("First-Outside-Inside-Last") method backwards:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, the expression
          <m>x^2-3x-4</m> can be factored as <m>(x-4)(x+1)</m>.
          Breaking this down,
          observe that the first terms in both <m>x-4</m> and <m>x+1</m> are <m>x</m> and multiply to the <m>x^2</m>.
          The outside terms <m>x</m> and <m>1</m> multiply to <m>x</m> while the inside terms <m>-4</m> and <m>x</m> multiply to <m>-4x</m>,
          and that these can be added together to get <m>-3x</m>.
          The last terms <m>-4</m> and <m>1</m> multiply to <m>-4</m>.

      Differences of squares can be factored with the use of the following formula:
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Formulas for Factoring Differences of Squares</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For all real numbers <m>n</m> and <m>m</m>,
          <me>
            n^2-m^2 = (n-m)(n+m)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The expression <m>x^2-4</m> can be rewritten as <m>x^2-2^2</m>,
          which is the difference of the square of <m>x</m> and the square of <m>2</m>.
          Thus the quadratic expression <m>x^2-4</m> can be factored as <m>(x-2)(x+2)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      There are more formulas for factoring differences of higher powers,
      but we won't introduce them here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason that factoring can help solve an equation is that a basic property of the real numbers is that a product can be equal to zero only if one of the factors in the product is zero.
      In the following theorem we use the term
      <em>real expressions,</em>
      which will denote any expressions that when calculated are real numbers.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_prodiszero">
      <title>A Product Is Zero If and Only If One of the Factors Is Zero</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any real expressions <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
          <m>AB=0</m> if and only if <m>A=0</m> or <m>B=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Returning to <m>3x^2-6x = 3x(x-2)</m> from Example <xref ref="ex_factoring1" autoname="yes"/>,
          the real expression <m>3x(x-2)</m> is a product of the real expressions <m>3x</m> and <m>x-2</m>.
          <m>3x=0</m> when <m>x=0</m> whereas <m>x-2=0</m> when <m>x=2</m>,
          and so the product <m>3x(x-2)=0</m> when <em>either</em>
          <m>x=0</m> or <m>x=2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the quadratic function
          <m>f(x) = 3x^2-6x</m> has zeros at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>.

          to verify that <m>f(x) = 3x^2-6x</m> crosses the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          We can solve the quadratic equation
          <m>x^2-4 = 0</m> via factoring the difference of squares as before and setting each factor equal to 0:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}x^2-4 \amp =0\\ (x-2)(x+2) \amp =0\\ x-2=0  \amp \text{ or }   x+2=0\\ x=2  \amp \text{ or }   x=-2 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the function <m>f(x) = x^2-4</m> has <m>x</m>-intercepts at <m>x=\pm 2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        If you try to solve <m>x^2-4=0</m> by adding 4 to both sides and taking the square root of both sides,
        you may think that there is only one solution when <m>x=2</m>.
        For this reason,
        factoring is a more reliable method for solving this type of equation!
        We will explore why exactly we get the positive and negative square root of 4 as the solutions to <m>x^2=4</m> in Section 1.7.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      The phrase "if and only if" in <xref ref="thm_prodiszero">Theorem</xref>
      is shorthand for saying that the implication goes both ways.
      The forward direction of this implication says that if <m>AB</m> is zero,
      then either <m>A</m> or <m>B</m>
      (or both)
      is zero. the backwards direction says that if <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> is zero,
      then <m>AB</m> is also zero.
      This theorem can be generalized to products involving more than two factors;
      for example,
      a product <m>ABCD=0</m> if and only if one or more of the factors <m>A</m>,
      <m>B</m>,
      <m>C</m>, and <m>D</m> is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Warning!</em> <xref ref="thm_prodiszero">Theorem</xref>
      applies only to equations that are set to zero, that is,
      equations of the form <m>AB=0</m>.
      Theorem does <em>not</em> say, for example,
      that <m>3x(x-2)=2</m> if and only if <m>3x=2</m> or <m>x-2=2</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          To find the solutions of the equation <m>x^2-3x=4</m>,
          we CANNOT factor the left-hand side and then set each factor equal to a divisor of <m>4</m>.
          For example, the following calculation is INCORRECT:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}x^2-3x \amp = 4\\ x(x-3) \amp = 2\cdot 2\\ x=2  \amp \text{ or }   x-3=2\\ x=2  \amp \text{ or }   x=5 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          However, when <m>x=2</m>,
          <me>
            x^2-3x = (2)^2-3(2) = 4-6=-2\neq 4
          </me>,
          and when <m>x=5</m>,
          <me>
            x^2-3x = (5)^2-3(5) = 25-15 = 10\neq 4
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The correct method is to first subtract the 4 from both sides so that the right side is 0, and then factor the left-hand side:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}x^2-3x \amp = 4\\ x^2-3x-4 \amp = 0\\ (x-4)(x+1) \amp = 0\\ x-4 = 0  \amp \text{ or }   x+1 = 0\\ x = 4  \amp \text{ or }   x = -1 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          You should check that <m>x^2-3x = 4</m> when either <m>x=4</m> or <m>x=-1</m> by plugging in those values and simplifying.
        </p>
      </statement>

      Unfortunately, some quadratic expressions,
      such as <m>3x^2-7x+1</m>, are not so easy to factor.
      If we wish to find the <m>x</m>-values that satisfy the quadratic equation <m>3x^2-7x+1=0</m> without factoring,
      we can apply the <em>quadratic formula</em>
      to determine the solutions.

      <title>The Quadratic Formula</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>a, b</m>, and <m>c</m> are real numbers,
          the solutions of the quadratic equation <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> are of the form
          <me>
            x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Deriving the quadratic formula involves a process called "completing the square" that we aren't going to get into, but
        <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUZ3s3JtrBE">here's a good video</url>
        on deriving this formula, in case you are interested.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Applying the quadratic formula to the equation <m>3x^2-7x+1=0</m>,
          we have <m>a=3</m>, <m>b=-7</m>,
          and <m>c=1</m>, so the solutions are
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}x \amp =  \frac{-(-7)\pm\sqrt{(-7)^2-4(3)(1)}}{2(3)}\\ \amp = \frac{7\pm\sqrt{49-12}}{6}\\ \amp =\frac{7\pm\sqrt{37}}{6} \end{aligned}
          </me>
          and so the quadratic function <m>q(x)=3x^2-7x+1</m> has two roots at
          <m>x=\frac{7+\sqrt{37}}{6}\approx 2.18046</m> and at <m>x=\frac{7-\sqrt{37}}{6}\approx 0.152873</m>.
          Once again, you should verify this using this

      The expression <m>b^2-4ac</m> is called the <em>discriminant</em>,
      and it determines the number of solutions of the quadratic equation <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>b^2-4ac</m> is positive,

            one when the <m>\pm</m> symbol is a plus and one when it is a minus.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>b^2-4ac</m> is zero,

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>b^2-4ac</m> is negative,
            then its square root is not a real number and thus the equation
            <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> has no real solutions.
            In this case the equation does have complex-number solutions,
            but in this book we will be concerned only with real numbers,
            so a quadratic equation with a negative discriminant will be said to have "no solutions."

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms and formulas were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    linear function, linear equation, identity function, constant function, quadratic function, quadratic equation, parameter, function with parameter;  <m>x</m>-intercept, zero of a function, <m>y</m>-intercept, positive (and negative), increasing (and decreasing), local maximum (and minimum), global maximum (and minimum), concave up (and concave down), inflection point; extrema, conjecture; slope-intercept form, point-slope form, and two-point form of a line; parallel, perpendicular; real expressions, difference of squares, quadratic formula, discriminant
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Linear and quadratic functions can be written in the forms
      <m>f(x)=mx+b</m> and <m>f(x) = ax^2+bx+c</m>, respectively,
      for particular values of the parameters <m>m, a, b</m>,
      and <m>c</m>.
      There are alternate forms for the equations of a line that can be useful.
      There are many methods for factoring quadratic equations and finding the <m>x</m>-intercepts of a quadratic function,
      including using the Quadratic Formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      Families of functions can have similar properties that change depending on the values of the parameters of the function.
      We wish to develop algebraic methods for determining the properties of functions so we do not have to rely on computer-generated graphs.
