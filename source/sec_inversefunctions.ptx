    <title>Why Inverse Functions?</title>
    <p>
      In order to study several categories of transcendental functions,
      you first need to know about inverse functions.
      Intuitively,
      an inverse function is a function that "undoes" another function.
      In this section we will first review some relevant properties of functions,
      define what it means to "undo" or "invert" a function,
      determine conditions under which we
      <em>can</em> invert a function,
      and then summarize some useful properties of inverse functions.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Brief Review of Functions</title>
    <p>
      Before discussing inverse functions,
      let's recall the basic definitions and terminology for functions from the beginning of the year:
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>function</em> <m>f</m> from a set <m>A</m> to a set <m>B</m> is a rule <m>f</m> that associates to each element <m>x</m> of the <em>domain</em>
      set <m>A</m> exactly one element <m>y=f(x)</m> of the
      <em>range</em> set <m>B</m>.
      We will use the notation
      <me>
        f: A\rightarrow B
      </me>
      to represent a function <m>f</m> together with its domain set <m>A</m> and range set <m>B</m>.
      This notation is pronounced "<m>f</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>." If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are variables that represent elements of the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
      respectively,
      then we say that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m> and write <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      The variable <m>x</m> is called the
      <em>independent variable</em>
      and represents the "input" of the function.
      The function <m>f</m> sends each input <m>x</m> to
      <em>one and only one</em>
      "output," some value of the <em>dependent variable</em> <m>y</m>.
      Notice that <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>,
      according to the assignment defined by the function <m>f</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The rule <m>F=g(C)=\frac{9}{5}C+32</m> is the function that takes Celsius temperature inputs <m>C</m> and produces the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature outputs <m>F</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the domain of <m>g</m> is all possible Celsius temperatures,
          and the range of <m>g</m> is all possible Fahrenheit temperatures.
          If we know that the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius,
          but want to know the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature,
          we can compute <m>g(25)=\frac{9}{5}(25)+32=77</m> degrees Fahrenheit.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Recall that the graph of a function must pass the
      <em>vertical line test</em>
      (Theorem <xref ref="thm_vlt" autoname="yes"/>):
    </p>
    <em>The Vertical Line Test:</em>
    A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The following is the graph of the function <m>F=g(C)=\frac{9}{5}C+32</m>.
          We can see that every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point,
          so this graph represents a function,
          because it passes the vertical line test.

    <title>Defining Inverse Functions</title>
    <p>
      Because every function is a process that converts a collection of inputs to a corresponding collection of outputs,
      a natural question is:
      for a particular function,
      can we <em>change perspective and think of the original function's outputs as the inputs for a reverse process</em>?
      If we phrase this question algebraically,
      it is analogous to asking:
      given an equation that defines <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>,
      is it possible to find a corresponding equation where <m>x</m> is a function of <m>y</m>?
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_Preview1-7-1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          It is possible to solve the equation <m>F=\frac{9}{5}C+32</m> for <m>C</m>.
          In other words,
          we are able to isolate <m>C</m> through a series of algebraic steps.
          Doing so results in the equation which takes Fahrenheit temperature inputs <m>F</m> and produces the corresponding Celsius temperature outputs <m>C</m>,
          meaning a function <m>C=h(F)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start with the equation
          <me>
            F=\frac{9}{5}C+32
          </me>
          and subtract <m>32</m> from both sides, to get
          <me>
            F-32=\frac{9}{5}C
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then to get <m>C</m> by itself,
          we multiply both sides by <m>\frac{5}{9}</m> to get
          <me>
            C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the equation <m>C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)</m> expresses <m>C</m> as a function of <m>F</m>.
          Call this function <m>h</m> so that <m>C=h(F)=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, <m>g</m> is a function which takes a temperature in degrees Celsius,
          and converts it to a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
          and <m>h</m> is a function which takes a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
          and converts it to a temperature in degrees Celsius.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a moment to think about what would happen if we convert from one system to the other and then back.
          In other words, what happens if we compose these functions?
          Lets find the simplest expression that we can for the composite function <m>j(C)=h(g(C))</m>.
          <me>
            <md>
              j(C)\amp =h(g(C))\\ \amp =\frac{5}{9}(g(C)-32)\\ \amp =\frac{5}{9}\left(\frac{9}{5}C+32-32\right)\\ \amp =\frac{5}{9}\left(\frac{9}{5}C\right)\\ \amp =C.
            </md>
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we find the simplest expression that we can for the composite function <m>k(F)=g(h(F))</m>:
          <me>
            <md>
              k(F)\amp =g(h(F))\\ \amp =\frac{9}{5}h(F)+32\\ \amp =\frac{9}{5}\left(\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\right)+32\\ \amp =(F-32)+32\\ \amp =F.
            </md>
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice how simple both of these compositions become!
          This is not a coincidence<ellipsis/>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      <em>Inverses Reverse Each Other!</em>
      In <xref ref="ex_Preview1-7-1">Example</xref>,
      we found that for the function <m>F=g(C)=\frac{9}{5}C+32</m>,
      it's possible to solve for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>F</m> and write <m>C=h(F) = \frac{5}{9}(C-32)</m>.
      The first function, <m>g</m>,
      converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit ones;
      the second function, <m>h</m>,
      converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius ones.
      Thus, the process <m>h</m> <em>reverses the process</em> of <m>g</m>,
      and likewise the process of <m>g</m>
      <em>reverses the process</em> of <m>h</m>.
      This is also why it makes sense that
      <m>j=h\circ g</m> and <m>k = g\circ h</m> are so simple,
      namely that <m>j(C) = h(g(C)) = C</m> and <m>k(F) = g(h(F)) = F</m>,
      meaning both compositions end up back where they started.
      If, for instance, we take a Celsius temperature <m>C</m>,
      convert it to Fahrenheit, and convert the result back to Celsius,
      we arrive back at the Celsius temperature we started with:
      <m>h(g(C)) = C</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar work is sometimes possible with other functions.
      When we can find a new function that reverses the process of the original function,
      we say that the original function "has an inverse function" and make the following formal definition.

      <title>The Inverse of a Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f:A\to B</m> be a function.
          If there exists a function <m>g: B\to A</m> such that
          <me>
            g(f(a))=a \textrm{  and  } f(g(b))=b
          </me>
          for each <m>a</m> in <m>A</m> and each <m>b</m> in <m>B</m>,
          then we say that <m>f</m> has an
          <em>inverse function</em>
          and that the function <m>g</m> is
          <em>the inverse of <m>f</m></em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A function is called <em>invertible</em>
          if it has in inverse function.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Notation:</em> When a given function <m>f</m> has a corresponding inverse function <m>g</m>,
          we usually rename <m>g</m> as <m>f^{-1}</m> which we read aloud as
          <q><m>f</m>-inverse</q>. The equation <m>g(f(a))=a</m> now reads
          <me>
            f^{-1}\big(f(a)\big)=a
          </me>,
          which we interpret as saying ``<m>f</m>-inverse converts <m>f(a)</m> back to <m>a</m>.
          We similarly write that
          <me>
            f\big(f^{-1}(b)\big)=b
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Note particularly what the equation <m>g(f(a))=a</m> says:
      for any input <m>a</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>. the function <m>g</m> will reverse the process of <m>f</m> (which converts <m>a</m> to <m>f(a)</m>) because <m>g</m> converts <m>f(a)</m> back to <m>a</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the two conditions in <xref ref="def_inverses">Definition</xref>
      guarantee that if a function <m>g</m> is the inverse of a function <m>f</m>,
      then <m>f</m> is the inverse of the function <m>g</m>.

          For example, the functions <m>f(x) = x^3</m> and
          <m>g(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}</m> are inverses of each other.
          Intuitively,
          taking the cube of a number is undone by taking the cube root,
          and vice versa.
          Its easy to verify this algebraically by converting <m>\sqrt[3]{x} = x^{1/3}</m>:
          <me>
            g(f(x))=\sqrt[3]{x^3}=(x^3)^{1/3} = x^{3\cdot(1/3)} = x^1 = x, \textrm{ and}

            f(g(x))=(\sqrt[3]{x})^3=(x^{1/3})^3 = x^{(1/3)\cdot 3} = x^1=x

          Thus we can write <m>f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}</m> for the inverse of <m>f(x) = x^3</m>.

          Recall that tables are a convenient way of summarizing corresponding inputs and outputs of a function.
          For instance, we know that <m>f(1977)=87</m>,
          meaning that in 1977, there were 87 operating drive-in movie theaters.
          On the other hand, given the data available,
          it is accurate to say that when there were 87 operating movie theaters,
          the year was 1977.
          In terms of functions, we can write <m>f^{-1}(87) = 1977</m>.
          Is this saying anything meaningfully different?
          No.
          Remember: inverse functions are just a change in perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can summarize the values of this inverse perspective in the table below simply by swapping the rows:

    <remark>
      <p>
        Notice that we sometimes swap the input and output variables while finding the inverse function
        (as in Example <xref ref="ex_invertingxcubed" autoname="yes"/>),
        while sometimes we do not swap variables
        (as in <xref ref="ex_dolbearinverse">Exercise</xref>).
        It is only appropriate to switch input and output variable for functions that are entirely abstract,
        and especially if we are talking about the inverse as its own function and want to graph it on the same set of axes as the original function.
        In cases where the variables represent real-world quantities,
        such as number of cricket chirps and temperature,
        it would not make sense to switch variables.

    <title>When is a Function Invertible?</title>
    <p>
      Not all functions have inverses.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_nonHLT">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, consider the squaring function
          <m>f(x) = x^2</m> with the domain <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
          How could we reverse the process defined by <m>f</m>?
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe that <m>f(2) = 4</m> and <m>f(-2)=4</m>.
          An inverse of <m>f</m> would have to send the input 4 back to both <m>2</m> and <m>-2</m> in order to reverse <m>f</m>.
          This violates our rules for a function since an input must have one and only one output.
          Thus <m>f(x) = x^2</m> does <em>not</em> have an inverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, <m>\sqrt{x^2} = x</m> is
          <em>not</em> always true,
          so that <m>\sqrt{x}</m> is <em>not</em>
          a true inverse to <m>x^2</m>.
          <em>Why not?
          Find a value for <m>x</m> such that <m>\sqrt{x^2}\neq x</m>.</em>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      It's important to note in <xref ref="def_inverses">Definition</xref> that we say "<em>If</em>
      there exists<ellipsis/>." That is,
      we are not guaranteed that an inverse function exists for a given function.
      Thus, we might ask:
      how can we determine whether or not a given function has a corresponding inverse function?
      As with many questions about functions,
      there are often three different possible ways to explore such a question:
      through a table, through a graph,
      or through an algebraic formula.

          The function <m>g</m> does not have an inverse function because there are two different inputs that lead to the same output:

          If we attempt to reverse this process,

          <m>0</m> and <m>4</m>.

          Note that if we try to reverse the rows of <xref ref="tab_notinvertible" autoname="yes"/>,

          We can thus make observations such as <m>h^{-1}(4)=2</m>,

          just from a different perspective.

      then the process of the function cannot be reversed and the function does not have an inverse.

        <p>
          We note explicitly that <m>p</m> is a function because its graph passes the Vertical Line Test.
          If we attempt to change perspective and use the graph of <m>p</m> to view <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>,
          we see that this fails because the <m>y</m>-value <m>c</m> is associated with two different <m>x</m>-values,
          <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
          Said differently,
          because the horizontal line <m>y=c</m> intersects the graph of <m>p</m> at both <m>(a,c)</m> and <m>(b,c)</m>,
          we cannot view <m>y</m> as the input to a function process that produces the corresponding <m>x</m>-value.
          If we turn our head to the side and view the <m>y</m>-axis as our inputs,
          the graph would not pass this tipped over Vertical Line Test.
          Therefore, <m>p</m> does not have an inverse function.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand,
          the function <m>q</m> does have an inverse because we can view <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m> via the graph
          (provided that the behavior seen in the figure continues).
          This is because for any choice of <m>y</m>,
          there corresponds one and only one <m>x</m> that results from <m>y</m>.
          We can think of this visually by starting at a value such as <m>y=c</m> on the <m>y</m>-axis,
          moving horizontally to where the line intersects the graph of <m>p</m> and then moving down to the corresponding location
          (here <m>x=a</m>)
          on the horizontal axis.
          From the behavior of the graph of <m>q</m> (a straight line that is always increasing),
          we see that this correspondence will hold for any choice of <m>y</m>,
          and thus indeed <m>x</m> is a function of <m>y</m>.
          From this, we can say that <m>q</m> indeed has an inverse function.
          We thus can write that <m>q^{-1}(c)=a</m>,
          which is a different way to express the equivalent fact that <m>q(a)=c</m>.
          Likewise, we can see that <m>q^{-1}(d) = b</m>, since <m>q(b) = d</m>.

      What have we observed so far?
      Functions are invertible provided that no two inputs produce the same output.
      Visually, no two points can be at the same height on the graph,
      so that no horizontal line intersects the graph in more than one point.
      The graphical observations that we made for the function <m>q</m> in <xref ref="ex_HLT">Example</xref>
      provide a general test for whether or not a function given by a graph has a corresponding inverse function.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_HLT">
      <title>Horizontal Line Test</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function whose graph lies in the <m>xy</m>-plane has a corresponding inverse function if and only if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once.
          When the graph passes this test,
          the horizontal coordinate of each point on the graph can be viewed as a function of the vertical coordinate of the point.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> whose graph passes the horizontal line test is said to be <em>one-to-one</em>.
          This is because the inputs and outputs of such a function pair uniquely with each other,
          without any "doubling up" of multiple inputs to one output.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way of stating that a function is one-to-one is that,
          for any values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> of the independent variable,
        </p>
        if <m>a\neq b</m>, then <m>f(a)\neq f(b)</m>.

          Equivalently, using the contrapositive, we can phrase this as

      <title>Finding the Inverse of an Invertible Function Algebraically</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Thanks to Example <xref ref="ex_visualinvertible1" autoname="yes"/>,
          we know that <m>y=r(t)=3-\dfrac{1}{5}(t-1)^3</m> is invertible,
          meaning that the inverse function <m>t=r^{-1}(y)</m> exists.
          To find an explicit formula for this function,
          we take the equation <m>y=3-\dfrac{1}{5}(t-1)^3</m>, and solve for <m>t</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, subtract <m>3</m> from both sides to get
          <me>
            y-3=-\dfrac{1}{5}(t-1)^3
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, multiplying both sides by <m>-5</m>, it follows that
          <me>
            -5(y-3)=(t-1)^3
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the cube root function has the property that
          <m>\sqrt[3]{z^3}=z</m> for every real number <m>z</m>
          (since the cube root function is the inverse function for the cubing function,
          and each function has both a domain and range of all real numbers),
          we can take the cube root of both sides of the preceding equation to get
          <me>
            \sqrt[3]{-5(y-3)}=t-1
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, adding 1 to both sides, we have determined that
          <me>
            t=1+\sqrt[3]{-5(y-3)}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we have been able to express <m>t</m> as a single function of <m>y</m> for every possible value of <m>y</m>,
          this shows that <m>r</m> indeed has an inverse and that <m>t=r^{-1}(y)=1+\sqrt[3]{-5(y-3)}</m>.

      <title>Visually and Algebraically NOT Invertible</title>

        <p>
          Consider the function <m>y=s(t)=3-\dfrac{1}{5}(t-1)^2</m> defined by the graph below:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <caption>The graph that defines function <m>s</m></caption>
          <image width="30%" source="ACFigure1-7-10-s.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          We can see that <m>s(t)</m> does NOT pass the horizontal line test;
          in particular, it looks like <m>s(2)=s(0)</m>,
          and using the formula <m>s(t) = 3-\frac{1}{5}(t-1)^2</m>,
          we can indeed calculate that <m>s(2)=s(0)=\dfrac{14}{5}</m>.
          Therefore <m>s(t)</m> does not have an inverse function.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if we did not have a picture?
          Would we still be able to determine that <m>y=s(t)</m> is not invertible?
          If we were to try to solve for <m>t</m> in terms of <m>y</m> algebraically,
          we could again subtract <m>3</m> from both sides to get
          <me>
            y-3=-\dfrac{1}{5}(t-1)^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, multiplying both sides by <m>-5</m>, it follows that
          <me>
            -5(y-3)=(t-1)^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, however, we encounter a crucial issue.
          Recall from <xref ref="ex_nonHLT">Example</xref>
          that the function <m>f(x)=x^2</m> does not have an inverse.
          It takes any nonzero number and its opposite to the same output (e.g.
          <m>(-5)^2=25=(5)^2</m>),
          this means that we have to account for both possible inputs that result in the same output.
          Based on our last equation, this means that either
          <me>
            t-1=\sqrt{-5(y-3)}\qquad\textrm{ or } \qquad t-1=-\sqrt{-5(y-3)}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, we find not a single equation that expresses <m>t</m> as a function of <m>y</m>,
          but rather two:
          <me>
            t=1+\sqrt{-5(y-3)}\qquad\textrm{ or } \qquad t=1-\sqrt{-5(y-3)}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          It appears that <m>t</m> cannot be expressed as a single function of <m>y</m>;
          and indeed, <m>y=s(t)=3-\dfrac{1}{5}(t-1)^2</m> does not have an inverse function.

      Property (e) above is new but follows immediately from property (d):
      because inverse functions reverse inputs and outputs,
      inverting a function reverses the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
      This means that the graph of the inverse of a function is a reflection of the graph of the original function across the line <m>y=x</m>.

          <m>f(x)</m> has the domain <m>[-1,\infty)</m> since we need

        <p>
          We can see from the graph below that <m>f(x)</m> is invertible and one-to-one because it passes the horizontal line test.

          In this example, the range of <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x+1}</m> was
          <m>[0,\infty)</m> so that the domain of
          <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> must be the same set <m>[0,\infty)</m>.
          We see this in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage68b" autoname="yes"/> above:
          only the half of the parabola with <m>x\geq 0</m> results from reflecting
          <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x+1}</m> across the line <m>y=x</m>.
          Thus when we consider <m>f^{-1}(x)=x^2-1</m> as the inverse of <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x+1}</m>,
          we must restrict the domain to <m>[0,\infty)</m>,
          as in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage68c" autoname="yes"/> below:

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    inverse function, <m>f^{-1}</m> is the inverse of <m>f</m>, invertible; Horizontal Line Test, one-to-one function.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> An inverse function reverses the process of a function,
      swapping perspective between "input" and "output" of the original function.
      Functions are invertible if and only if they pass the Horizontal Line Test.
      Equivalently, functions are invertible if they are one-to-one.
      The graph of the inverse of a function is the reflection of the graph of the function over the line <m>y=x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      Some functions that are <em>not</em>
      invertible have partial inverses,
      obtained by restricting the domain of the function to an interval on which the function passes the Horizontal Line Test.
