    <title>A Review of Function Composition</title>
    <p>
      With the rules we have developed so far,
      we can differentiate any constant multiple,
      sum, difference, product, or quotient of functions<fn>
      Another way to say this is, "any arithmetic combination of functions."
      </fn> whose components have known derivatives.
      There is one last common way to combine functions algebraically,
      and that is by <em>composing</em> them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, let's consider the function
      <me>
        h(x) = \sqrt{x^2+1}
      </me>
      and observe that any input <m>x</m> passes through a
      <em>chain</em> of functions.
      In the process that defines the function <m>h(x)</m>,
      <m>x</m> is squared and increased by 1, and then the square root of the result is taken.
      Using an arrow diagram,
      <me>
        x \rightarrow  x^2+1 \rightarrow  \sqrt{x^2+1}
      </me>.
      In terms of the elementary functions
      <m>f(x)   = \sqrt{x}</m> and <m>g(x) = x^2+1</m>,
      we observe that <m>x</m> is the input for the function <m>g</m> and the output of <m>g</m> is used as the input for <m>f</m>.
      We write
      <me>
        h(x) = f(g(x)) =\sqrt{x^2+1}
      </me>
      and say that <m>h</m> is the <em>composition</em>
      of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
      We will refer to <m>g</m>,
      the function that is first applied to <m>x</m>,
      as the <em>inner</em> function, while <m>f</m>,
      the function that is applied to the result,
      is the <em>outer</em> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a composite function
      <m>h(x) = f(g(x))</m> that is built from differentiable functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
      how do we compute <m>h'(x)</m> in terms of <m>f, g, f'</m>,
      and <m>g'</m>?
      In the same way that the rate of change of a product of two functions,
      <m>p(x) = f(x)g(x)</m>,
      depends on the behavior of both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> and their derivatives,
      it makes sense intuitively that the rate of change of a composite function
      <m>h(x) = f(g(x))</m> will also depend on some combination of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> and their derivatives.
      The rule that describes how to compute <m>h'</m> in terms of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> and their derivatives is called the <em>chain rule.</em>
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="ex_prechainrule">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = -4x+7</m> and <m>g(x) = 3x-5</m>.
          Simplify a formula for <m>h(x) = f(g(x))</m> and compute <m>h'(x)</m> using the derivatives rules you already know.
          Can you see how <m>h'</m> is related to <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> and their derivatives?
          Read on to find out<ellipsis/>

      </statement>
    </exercise>

  <subsection>
    <title>Real-World Motivation for the Chain Rule</title>
    <p>
      Let's consider an example involving rates of change.
      Suppose you are making some extra money selling pumpkins this fall.
      On a busy Saturday, you can sell 30 pumpkins in an hour.
      Suppose you get the pumpkins bulk and mark them up,
      so you make $10 for each pumpkin you sell.
      How much money do you make per hour on a busy Saturday?
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrive at the answer by using a product:
      <me>
        300\ \frac{\text{ dollars } }{\text{ hour } }=\left(10\ \frac{\text{ dollars } }{\text{ pumpkin } }\right)\cdot\left(30\ \frac{\text{ pumpkins } }{\text{ hour } }\right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's now relate this to derivatives and composition of functions.
      Let <m>p(t)</m> be the number of pumpkins sold <m>t</m> hours after you start selling,
      and let <m>m(p)</m> be the amount of money you make selling <m>p</m> pumpkins.
      Then the composition <m>m(p(t))</m> is the amount of money you've made <m>t</m> hours after you start selling.
      We are interested in the rate of change of profit per hour,
      which is the derivative <m>\frac{dm}{dt}</m>.
      The fact that you make a profit of
      <m>\frac{dm}{dp} = 10</m> dollars per pumpkin and the fact that you sell
      <m>\frac{dp}{dt} = 30</m> pumpkins per hour are also statements about derivatives.
      Pay careful attention to the units of all of these derivatives,
      along with which variable is used for the derivative!
      Repeating our previous calculation,
      we can relate the derivatives of the composition <m>m(p(t))</m> to the derivatives of <m>m(p)</m> and <m>p(t)</m>:
      <me>
        \frac{dm}{dt} = \left(\frac{dm}{dp}\right)\cdot \left(\frac{dp}{dt}\right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we take a closer look at the Leibniz notation,
      we'll get a better idea of what's going on.
      <m>\frac{dm}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\left(m(p(t))\right)</m> means that we are viewing <m>m</m> as a function of <m>t</m>,
      so the input is time <m>t</m> in hours and the output is the change in money in dollars per hour.<fn>
      The pumpkins are being ignored.
      Note that in the Leibniz notation for the chain rule,
      the <m>dp</m>'s look like they cancel with each other.
      </fn> <m>\frac{dp}{dt}=p'(t)</m> means that we are viewing <m>p</m> as a function of <m>t</m>,
      so the input is time <m>t</m> in hours and the output the change in pumpkins per hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, <m>\frac{dm}{dp}</m> means that we are viewing <m>m</m> as a function of <m>p</m>,
      so the input is pumpkins <m>p</m> while the output is the change in money per pumpkin.
      In other words,
      we are taking pumpkins <m>p(t)</m> and getting out the change in money <m>m'</m>.
      In prime notation,
      <me>
        \frac{dm}{dp} = m'(p) = m'(p(t))
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So the computation that we did in computing <m>300\text{ dollars/hour }  = (10\text{ dollars/pumpkin } )\times (30\text{ pumpkins/hour } )</m> was actually
      <me>
        \big[m(p(t))\big]' = m'(p(t))\cdot p'(t)
      </me>
    </p>

    <title>The Formula for the Chain Rule</title>
    <theorem>
      <title>The Chain Rule</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>f(u(x))</m> is a composition of functions.
          Then for all values of <m>x</m> at which <m>u</m> is differentiable at <m>x</m> and <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>u(x)</m>,
          the derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m> is equal to the product of the derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>u</m> and the derivative of <m>u</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.
          In Leibniz notation, we write this as
          <me>
            \frac{df}{dx}=\frac{df}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In
          <q>prime</q>
          notation, we write it as
          <me>
            (f\circ u)'(x)=f'(u(x))\cdot u'(x)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>f(x) = (x^4+5x)^3</m>.
          The "inner" function is <m>u(x) = x^4+5x</m> while the "outer" function is <m>f(u) = u^3</m>.
          Taking the derivative of each:
          <me>
            \frac{du}{dx} = u'(x) = 4x^3+5
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \frac{df}{du} = f'(u) =  3u^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will need to use <m>f'(u(x))</m> in the chain rule,
          not just <m>f'(u)</m>.
          Substituting <m>u=x^4+5x</m> into <m>f'(u)</m> results in
          <me>
            f'(u(x)) = 3(x^4+5x)^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting all of this together in the whole chain rule,
          the derivative of <m>f(x)</m> is
          <me>
            <md>
              \frac{df}{dx} \amp = \frac{df}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx} \amp  \leftarrow \text{ Chain Rule } \\ \amp = (3u^2)\cdot (4x^3+5) \amp  \leftarrow \frac{df}{du} = 3u^2\text{ and } \frac{du}{dx} = 4x^3+5\\ \amp = 3(x^4+5x)^2 \cdot (4x^3+5) \amp  \leftarrow \text{ Substitute } u=x^4+5x
            </md>
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let's return to the first example at the start of the section and find the derivative using the chain rule.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <m>h(x) =\sqrt{x^2+1} = (x^2+1)^{1/2}</m> is a composition of the outer function
          <m>f(u)=\sqrt{u}=u^{1/2}</m> with the inner function <m>u(x)=x^2+1</m>.
          The chain rule says that we should take the derivative of the outside function <m>f</m> with respect to <m>u</m> and then multiply the result by the derivative of the inside function:
          <me>
            h'(x) =\frac{df}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}= f'(u(x))\cdot u'(x)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          First let's calculate the derivatives of <m>f</m> and <m>u</m>,
          then put them into the formula.
          <me>
            \frac{df}{du}=f'(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^{-1/2}
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \frac{du}{dx} = u'(x)  = 2x
          </me>.
          We don't want our derivative in terms of <m>u</m>'s, however,
          so we will substitute the function <m>u=x^2+1</m> into our final answer:
          <me>
            <md>
              h'(x)\amp =f'(u(x))\cdot u'(x)\amp  \leftarrow \text{ Chain Rule } \\ \amp =\frac{1}{2}(u)^{-1/2}\cdot(2x)\amp  \leftarrow f'(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^{-1/2}\text{ and } u'(x)  = 2x\\ \amp =\frac{1}{2}(x^2+1)^{-1/2}(2x). \amp  \leftarrow \text{ Substitute } u=x^2+1
            </md>
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>

    <title>More Examples Using the Chain Rule</title>
    <p>
      Because using the chain rule takes practice,
      here are many more examples.
      If you have time, try to compute the derivatives yourself first,
      before checking your work against the solution.
      Or come back later and use these for practice after class.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Take the derivative of <m>y=(4x^2+3x)^9</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The inside function is <m>u(x) = 4x^2+3x</m> while the outside function is <m>f(u) = u^9</m>.
          <m>u'(x) = 8x+3</m> and <m>f'(u) = 9u^8</m>,
          so that <m>f'(u(x)) = f'(4x^2+3x) = 9(4x^2+3x)^8</m>.
          Then
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}y' \amp = f'(u(x)) u'(x)\\ \amp =9(u(x))^8 (8x+3)\\ \amp = 9(4x^2+3x)^8(8x+3) \end{aligned}

          </me>

    <title>Combining Derivative Rules</title>
    <p>
      Take a moment to refresh your memory of the previous derivative rules in <xref ref="thm_derivativesmultiplessums">Theorem</xref>,
      <xref ref="thm_productrule">Theorem</xref>,
      and <xref ref="thm_quotientrule">Theorem</xref>.
      We will be using them along with the chain rule in a moment.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Chaining the chain rule</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's find the derivative of <m>y=\sqrt{1+(2x-1)^3}</m>.
          The outer-most function is
          <m>f(u) = \sqrt{u}</m> where <m>u(x) = 1+(2x-1)^3</m>.
          However, this has <em>its own</em>
          inside function of <m>2x-1</m>,
          whose derivative is <m>2</m>,
          so we will need to use the chain rule while taking the derivative of <m>u</m>.
          You found in the previous exercise that the derivative of
          <m>(2x-1)^3</m> is <m>3(2x-1)^2\cdot (2) = 6(2x-1)^2</m>.
          Putting these together and simplifying, we have
          <me>
            <md>
              y'\amp  = \frac{1}{2}\left(1+(2x-1)^3\right)^{-1/2}\cdot 3(2x-1)^2\cdot (2) \\ \amp = \frac{(3)(2)(2x-1)^2}{2\left(1+(2x-1)^3\right)^{1/2}}\\ \amp =\frac{3(2x-1)^2}{\sqrt{1+(2x-1)^3}}
            </md>
          </me>
        </p>

          Note that some 2's cancel.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the chain rule to find the derivative of <m>h(x)=\left(\dfrac{x}{1-3x^2}\right)^4</m>.
          Start by identifying the inside function and taking its derivative.

          Find the derivative of

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The function <m>h(x)</m> at its outermost layer is a product of <m>(x^2-1)^5</m> and <m>(3x-1)^2</m>.
          We begin by applying the product rule,
          using Leibniz notation to denote derivatives that we have not yet computed:
          <me>
            h'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\Big[(x^2-1)^5\Big]\cdot (3x-1)^2 + (x^2-1)^5\cdot \frac{d}{dx}\Big[(3x-1)^2\Big]
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We must use the chain rule to find the derivatives
          <m>\frac{d}{dx}\left[(x^2-1)^5\right]</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx}\left[(3x-1)^2\right]</m>:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left[(x^2-1)^5\right] = 5(x^2-1)^4(2x)
          </me>
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left[(3x-1)^2\right] = 2(3x-1)^1(3)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting these into the product rule that we already started, we have
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\Big[(x^2-1)^5\Big]\cdot (3x-1)^2 + (x^2-1)^5\cdot \frac{d}{dx}\Big[(3x-1)^2\Big]\\ \amp =\left(5(x^2-1)^4(2x)\right)\cdot (3x-1)^2+(x^2-1)^5\cdot \left(2(3x-1)^1(3)\right) \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This expression can be simplified <em>substantially</em>.
          To do so, first notice that there are common factors of <m>2</m>,
          <m>(x^2-1)^4</m>,
          and <m>(3x-1)</m> in both terms that can be pulled out:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp =\left(5(x^2-1)^4(2x)\right)\cdot (3x-1)^2+(x^2-1)^5\cdot \left(2(3x-1)^1(3)\right)\\ \amp = 2(x^2-1)^4(3x-1)\left[5(x)(3x-1)+(x^2-1)(3)\right] \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we can simplify the remaining expression inside the brackets,
          leaving the rest factored:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = 2(x^2-1)^4(3x-1)\left[5(x)(3x-1)+(x^2-1)(3)\right]\\ \amp = 2(x^2-1)^4(3x-1)[15x^2-5x+3x^2-3]\\ \amp = 2(x^2-1)^4(3x-1)(18x^2-5x-3) \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          While simplifying to this final form is not essential (WeBWorK will not require you to simplify),
          it will be necessary for actually being able to use the derivative in the context of an application.

    <title>A Proof of the Quotient Rule</title>
    <p>
      If you are like me (Dr.
      Goldstein) and always manage to make some kind of error while using the Quotient Rule,
      you may be interested in the proof below.
      It essentially amounts to showing you how to use the Chain Rule and the Product Rule instead of the Quotient Rule.
      It's not "easier" or "better," but it's another way of doing the same computation.
      You may safely ignore it if that does not sound appealing to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we wish to take the derivative of
      <me>
        h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
      </me>
      but would rather not use the Quotient Rule.
      Instead, we can rewrite <m>h(x)</m> using a negative exponent with <m>g(x)</m>:
      <me>
        h(x) = f(x)\cdot (g(x))^{-1}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is now a product of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>(g(x))^{-1}</m>,
      where we would need to use the chain rule to take the derivative of <m>(g(x))^{-1}</m>.
      Carrying out these rules
      (in the proper order),
      we have
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = f'(x)\cdot (g(x))^{-1} + f(x)\cdot \left(-(g(x))^{-2}\cdot g'(x)\right)\\ \amp = \frac{f'(x)}{g(x)}-\frac{f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2} \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second line,
      we have simplified by writing anything with a negative exponent in the denominator.
      Rewriting this as a single fraction via a common denominator of <m>g(x)^2</m>,
      we arrive at the Quotient Rule:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp =\frac{f'(x)\cdot g(x)}{g(x)\cdot g(x)}-\frac{f(x)g'(x)}{(g(x))^2}\\ \amp = \frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2} \end{aligned}
      </me>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following formulas were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    The Chain Rule.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The Chain Rule is used to take the derivative of a composition of functions.
      The Chain Rule consists of taking the derivative of an "outer" function,
      then multiplying by the derivative of the "inner" function.
      Watching many examples of the Chain Rule is typically necessary in order to be able to carry out the procedure yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      We will soon need to use all of the derivative rules in combination with each other,
      along with simplifying our answers,
      so you should start practicing.
      The Product and Chain Rules can be used in place of the Quotient Rule.
