    <title>The Definition of a Function</title>
    <p>
      A function is a fundamental mathematical object that will form the basis of everything we study this year.
      In this section, we will explore their definition and its meaning,
      several ways of representing a function,
      and a physical example of how functions are manifest in real-world phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does the word "function" mean to you?
      Pause for a moment and consider<ellipsis/>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you look up "function" in the Merriam-Webster dictionary
      (click on this link:
      <url href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/function">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/function</url>),
      there are many different meanings.
      Which ones agree with the ideas you already had?
      The fifth entry<fn>
      <url href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/function">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/function</url>
      accessed August 1, 2022
      </fn> is the one we shall use,
      and we shall use both parts of it:
    </p>
    <em>function</em> (noun)
    <ol marker="labelalph">
      <li>
        <p>
          a mathematical correspondence that assigns exactly one element of one set to each element of the same or another set
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          a variable (such as a quality, trait,
          or measurement) that depends on and varies with another For example "Height is a function of age."
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Part (a) of this definition is the abstracted,
      theoretical idea of a function.
      Part (b) of this definition is the reason we are interested in functions:
      we wish to describe relationships between real-world quantities.
      We will begin with the abstract idea before applying this knowledge to something more concrete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a formal,
      mathematical statement that we shall take to be the precise meaning of the word "function" for the rest of the year.
      Return to it as you read the examples that follow in order to make sense of the notation and terminology.

          A <em>function</em> <m>f</m> is a rule that takes certain numbers <m>a</m> in the set <m>A</m> as inputs and assigns to each a single number <m>b</m> in the set <m>B</m> as the output.
        </p>
        <p>
          The notation
          <me>
            f: A\rightarrow B
          </me>
          represents a function <m>f</m> together with its input set <m>A</m> and output set <m>B</m>.
          It is pronounced "<m>f</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>." The notation
          <me>
            b=f(a)
          </me>,
          pronounced "<m>b</m> is equal to <m>f</m> of <m>a</m>," represents the assignment of the output <m>b</m> to the input <m>a</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collection of symbols <m>f(a)=b</m> is called
          <em>function notation</em>,
          where the <m>a</m> in parentheses is called the
          <em>independent variable</em>
          and represents the input of the function.
          The output of the function is represented by either <m>f(a)</m> or <m>b</m>,
          which is called the <em>dependent variable</em>
          because its value depends on the choice of input.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        It is particularly important that each input has only one output.
        Think about the function as a machine, the input as a command,
        and the output as a task the machine will perform based on which command you give.
        When you give the machine an instruction,
        it should consistently perform a predictable task.
        You don't want it to be unpredictable and do different tasks based on the same instruction.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="ex_xsquared">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the rule that takes a real number and squares it is a function.
          Since the result is also a real number, we write
          <me>
            f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}
          </me>
          where the symbol <m>\mathbb{R}</m> is used to represent the
          <em>set of all real numbers</em>.
          In this example,
          <m>\mathbb{R}</m> is both our input and our output set.
          This will be the case for many of the examples we study this semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          Introducing some notation,
          let's call the number we are squaring <m>x</m> so that once we square it,
          we may write <m>x^2</m>.
          We can pick the name <m>f</m> to refer to this function by writing <m>f(x) = x^2</m>,
          which is pronounced "<m>f</m> of <m>x</m> is equal to <m>x</m> squared." Thus we have chosen <m>x</m> as the symbol we use to represent our
          <em>independent variable</em>.
          We can also choose to represent our outputs with the
          <em>dependent variable</em>
          <m>y</m> and can use the notation <m>y=x^2</m> or <m>y=f(x)</m> to represent the fact that the values of <m>y</m> are the result of squaring <m>x</m>,
          or equivalently, applying the function <m>f</m> to <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance,
          if we choose the input value <m>x=3</m>, then we write
          <me>
            f(3) = 3^2 = 9
          </me>,
          which is read "<m>f</m> of <m>3</m> is equal to <m>3</m> squared,
          which is equal to <m>9</m>." The number <m>9</m> is the output of the function when the input is <m>3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could also use the input value <m>x=-3</m>, and then we would write
          <me>
            f(-3)=(-3)^2 = 9
          </me>,
          which is read "<m>f</m> of negative <m>3</m> is equal to negative <m>3</m> squared,
          which is equal to <m>9</m>." The number <m>9</m> is again the output of the function when the input is <m>-3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pictures below illustrate how the function <m>f</m> behaves as a machine that takes the input (<m>x, 3</m>,
          or <m>-3,\ldots</m>) to the output (<m>f(x), 9</m>, or <m>9,\ldots</m>).

          What are two other examples of functions that you can think of?
          These may be mathematical examples that you have seen before,
          or they may be real-world examples of a quantity that varies depending on another.
          Try to be creative!

      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      In Example <xref ref="ex_xsquared" autoname="yes"/>,
      you saw two different ways of representing the same function:
      a description in words (a rule that squares numbers) and a formula (<m>f(x) = x^2</m>).
      There are two additional ways to represent a function (a table and graph),
      making four total ways to represent a function:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            a description in words
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            a formula
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            a table
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            a graph
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will need to be able to work with all four of these representations.
      Depending on what information we are given and what questions we have,
      one may be more or less useful than another.

          Continuing with our function
          <m>f(x) = x^2</m> that squares numbers,
          it would be very tedious to list out all of the different assignments for the function <m>f</m> one by one,
          so instead we can collect them in a table.
          <xref ref="tab_xsquared" autoname="yes"/> below has inputs of the function <m>f</m> in the top row with their corresponding outputs below them in the second row:

          We soon realize that this is also quite tedious.
          After all, we have only listed seven values of the function and they are all integers.
          What about all of the decimals between them??? It would be much quicker to illustrate all of the assignments of the function <m>f</m> in a picture.

    <title>Domain and Range of a Function</title>
    <p>
      The function <m>f(x)=x^2</m> in Examples <xref ref="ex_xsquared" autoname="yes"/> and <xref ref="ex_xsquaredcont" autoname="yes"/> is fairly typical in that both the input and output sets are numbers;
      most of the functions we consider this year will have numbers as inputs and outputs.
      In order to be more precise in our discussion of functions,
      we introduce some additional terminology to describe the input and output sets:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <title>Domain and Range of a Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is a function between unspecified subsets of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>,
          then we will take the <em>domain</em>
          of <m>f</m> to be the largest subset of
          <m>\mathbb{R}</m> for which <m>f</m> is defined:
          <me>
            \text{ Domain } (f) = \{\text{ real numbers } x\text{ such that }  f(x)\text{ is defined } \}
          </me>.
          The <em>range</em> of such a function is the set of all possible outputs that it can attain:
          <me>
            \text{ Range } (f) = \{\text{ real numbers } y\text{ such that we can find } x\text{ in Domain } (f)\text{ for which } f(x) = y\}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Returning to the squaring function
          <m>f(x)=x^2</m> in Example <xref ref="ex_xsquared" autoname="yes"/>.
          Because we can take any number <m>x</m> as an input and successfully square it,
          the domain of <m>f(x)</m> is indeed the set of all real numbers <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
          However, notice that some real numbers can never serve as outputs,
          because squares of real numbers can never be negative.
          The <em>range</em> of the squaring function is real numbers that are greater than or equal to zero.
          Here are two different ways of describing that set symbolically:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                With "set notation" <m>\{y\in \mathbb{R}\mid y\geq 0\}</m> where the symbol "<m>\in</m>" means "in" and the symbol "<m>\mid</m>" means "such that," so that this expression translates directly as "the set of <m>y</m> in the real numbers such that <m>y</m> is greater than or equal to zero." It is more common to omit the formal set notation and simply use the inequality <m>y\geq 0</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                With "interval notation" <m>[0,\infty)</m> where the symbol "<m>[</m>" means that we include the left endpoint <m>0</m> and the symbol "<m>)</m>" means that we do not include right endpoint;
                together with the infinity symbol <m>\infty</m>,
                the right side of this interval extends forever.
                We can visualize this on a number line:
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

    <remark>
      <p>
        While we will only refer to the domain and range of a function,
        there is another set that you may encounter relating to functions:
        the <em>codomain</em>.
        When we use the notation
        <me>
          f:A\to B
        </me>
        to represent a function,
        the set <m>A</m> is the domain but the set <m>B</m> is called the <em>codomain</em>
        and does not have to be the same as the range of the function.
        The range of a function is either equal to or is a subset of the codomain.
        For example,
        when looking at the function <m>f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}</m> defined by
        <m>f(x) = x^2</m> in Example <xref ref="ex_xsquared" autoname="yes"/>,
        the codomain is <m>\mathbb{R}</m> while the range is the set of numbers greater than or equal to <m>0</m>.

    <example xml:id="ex_introsqrt">
      <title>A Function with a Square Root</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>g(x) = \sqrt{4-x}</m>.
          We can successfully use the value <m>x=0</m> as an input because

        <p>
          However, if we try to plug in <m>x=5</m>,
          we do not get an output because we cannot take square roots of negative numbers:
          <me>
            g(5) = \sqrt{4-5} = \sqrt{-1}\text{ is undefined }
          </me>.
          Thus <m>x=-4, -3,\ldots, 3, 4</m> ARE in the domain of <m>g</m> while <m>x=5</m> is NOT in the domain of <m>g</m>.
          How can we determine exactly where the domain begins and ends?
          Since we need the quantity inside the square root to be non-negative,
          meaning 0 or greater, we set up and solve the inequality
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}4-x \amp \geq 0\\ +x \amp  \amp  +x\\ \hline 4 \amp \geq x \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence any value of <m>x</m> that is equal or less than 4 is in the domain,
          which we write as either <m>x\leq 4</m> or <m>(-\infty,4]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determining the range of <m>g(x)</m> is aided by looking at a graph:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_introsqrt">
          <caption>A graph of the function <m>y=\sqrt{4-x}</m>.</caption>
          <image width="50%" source="introsqrt.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Thus we see that the smallest value we can get as an output is <m>y=0</m>,
          while it looks like the values of <m>y</m> continue to increase as the values of <m>x</m> become more and more negative.
          Thus from the graph,
          it appears that the range of the function is <m>y\geq 0</m>.

      <title>A Function with a Denominator</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Below is the graph of the function <m>h(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2-4}</m>.
          Note that even though there are three distinct curves that make up the graph,
          each <m>x</m>-value only has one part of the curve above or below it,
          so we can determine from the curve the associated <m>y</m>-value given by the function.
          For instance,
          the point on the graph <m>(1,h(1))</m> is plotted in blue,
          and we can estimate from the picture that <m>y=h(1)\approx -0.3</m>.
          Finding the precise value from the formula, we see that
          <me>
            h(1) = \dfrac{1}{1^2-4} = \frac{1}{1-4} = -\frac{1}{3}
          </me>

          <image width="65%" source="Ch1Sec1RationalFunction.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Looking closely at the graph,
          it appears that the parts of the curve near <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=2</m> become nearly vertical,
          and it's not clear what <m>y</m>-value we are meant to use for <m>h(-2)</m> and <m>h(2)</m>.
          In fact, there are NO <m>y</m>-values associated with <m>h(-2)</m> and <m>h(2)</m>;
          <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=2</m> are not in the domain of this function!
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see algebraically that when we try to compute the value of the function at <m>x=-2</m>,
          we end up dividing by <m>0</m>, which is undefined:
          <me>
            h(-2)  = \frac{1}{(-2)^2-4} = \frac{1}{4-4} = \frac{1}{0}\text{ , which is undefined. }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, <m>h(2)</m> is undefined:
          <me>
            h(2)  = \frac{1}{(2)^2-4} = \frac{1}{4-4} = \frac{1}{0}\text{ , which is undefined. }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the only <m>x</m>-values for which the denominator is equal to <m>0</m>,<fn>
          You will learn how to determine this in  <xref ref="sec_linearandquadraticfunctions" autoname="yes"/>.
          </fn> so we can confirm from both the graph and the formula of the function <m>h</m> that its domain is
          <me>
            x\neq -2,2
          </me>.
          which we can write using interval notation as
          <me>
            x\in (-\infty,-2)\cup(-2,2)\cup(2,\infty)
          </me>.
          The round parentheses mean we do not include the endpoints at <m>-2</m> and <m>2</m>,
          and <m>\cup</m> is the "union" symbol,
          which means we are glueing the intervals together.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the graph,
          it appears that the range of <m>y=h(x)</m> does not include all values of <m>y</m>;
          the right- and left-most parts of the graph approach the <m>x</m>-axis,
          and so the <m>y</m>-values get close to <m>0</m>,
          but the middle part of the graph has a distinct gap at the top and the <m>y</m>-values do not seem to quite reach 0.
          Experiment with the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> by clicking on the Desmos graph
        </p>
        <url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7sh4jaq0ox">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7sh4jaq0ox</url>.
        <p>
          The point <m>(a,h(a))</m> is plotted in purple and there is a slider where you can adjust the values of <m>a</m>.
          Note that Desmos gives a value for <m>y=h(a)</m> everywhere except for when <m>a=-2</m> and <m>a=2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see using the Desmos graph that the highest point on the middle part of the graph occurs at <m>x=0</m> when <m>h(0) = -\frac{1}{4} = -0.25</m>.
          Thus the range of <m>h(x)</m> includes all values of <m>y</m> that are greater than 0, from the left and right curves,
          or that are less than or equal to
          <m>-\frac{1}{4}</m>, from the middle curve.
          This is written in interval notation as:
          <me>
            (-\infty,-1/4)\cup(0,\infty)

    <title>Non-Functions and the Vertical Line Test</title>
    <p>
      So, what <em>isn't</em> a function?
      If a rule assigns a real-number input to more than one output,
      then that rule is not a function.
      In this subsection,
      we learn a theorem to help us determine graphically whether or not a relationship is a function.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>A Non-Example</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          consider the relationship between the independent variable <m>x</m> and the dependent variable <m>y</m> where the square of <m>y</m> is equal to <m>x</m>.
          We could write this as <m>y^2 = x</m>,
          where we remember that the input is <m>x</m>.
          For example, if we take <m>x=4</m>,
          then the output <m>y</m> is a number that squares to <m>4</m>.
          This could be either <m>y=2</m> or <m>y=-2</m>,
          since <m>2^2=4</m> and <m>(-2)^2 = 4</m>.
          Since we don't know which to choose,
          we say that "<m>y</m> is not defined as a function of <m>x</m>."
        </p>
        <p>
          Algebraically,
          we could try to "solve" the equation <m>y^2=x</m> for <m>y</m> by writing <m>y=\pm\sqrt{x}</m>,
          and we see that we have the same issue where the input <m>x=4</m> corresponds to <em>two</em>
          different <m>y</m>-values,
          both <m>y=-2</m> and <m>y=2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you think of a function as a machine or algorithm that is required to return a single value,
          this ambiguity in having either <m>y=2</m> or <m>y=-2</m> as our output can be thought of as a program that crashes and fails to complete its task.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Here is another example of a relationship between variables that does not describe a function.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>A relationship described by a formula and graph that is NOT a function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The relationship between the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> given by the equation
          <me>
            x^2+y^2=16
          </me>
          is graphed in <xref ref="fig_ch1sec1circle" autoname="yes"/> below in red.
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_ch1sec1circle">
          <caption>The red circle is the points <m>(x,y)</m> that satisfy the equation <m>x^2+y^2=16</m>.</caption>
          <image width="50%" source="Ch1Sec1Circle.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          If we let <m>x=1</m>, we can solve for <m>y</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}(1)^2+y^2 \amp =16\\ y^2 \amp =16-1\\ y^2 \amp =15\\ y \amp = \pm\sqrt{15}\approx \pm3.873 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The points <m>(1,\sqrt{15})</m> and
          <m>(1,-\sqrt{15})</m> are labeled in blue and green, respectively.
          Thus we see that when <m>x=1</m>,
          there are <em>two</em> <m>y</m>-values given by the equation instead of <m>1</m>,
          and without more information,
          we do not know which to use.
          So we see that <m>y</m> cannot be defined as a function of <m>x</m> from the equation <m>x^2+y^2=16</m>,
          even though it defines a very nice curve (a circle of radius 4).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <m>x=1</m> was picked at random.
          You can see from the picture of the circle that there are many other points where a single <m>x</m>-value corresponds to two different <m>y</m>-values,
          in particular anywhere that a vertical line passes through the circle twice.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let's summarize the key property that determines whether or not a relationship or process is a function:
    </p>
    each input has one and only one output.
    <p>
      Thus, the usual way to demonstrate that a relationship or process is <em>not</em>
      a function is to find a particular input that is associated with two or more outputs.
      When the relationship is given graphically,
      we can use the vertical line test to determine whether or not the graph represents a function:
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_vlt">
      <title>The Vertical Line Test</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>Functions</h><h>Vertical Line Test</h></idx>
          A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the graph passes this test,
          the vertical coordinate of each point on the graph can be viewed as a function of the horizontal coordinate of the point.
          When the graph does not pass this test,
          the vertical coordinate cannot be viewed as a function of the horizontal coordinate.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <example>
      <title>A graph that is not a function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage39b" autoname="yes"/>,
          the marked vertical line passes through the graph twice,
          and so the graph does not pass the Vertical Line Test.
          Thus the vertical coordinate <m>y</m> cannot be viewed as a function of the horizontal coordinate <m>x</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This graph corresponds to the equation <m>y^2-4y = x-5</m>.
          Because we already know from the Vertical Line Test that <m>y</m> is not a function of <m>x</m>,
          we <em>cannot</em> rewrite this equation as <m>y=f(x)</m>,

                The relationship between the circumference of a circle and its diameter is a function.
                If we are given a diameter,
                we can determine the circumference of the correspondingly sized circle in an unambiguous way.
                Can you remember how?

                The relationship between people and phone numbers is NOT a function.
                A given individual person can be associated with more than one phone number,
                such as their cell phone and their work telephone.
                This means that we can't view phone numbers as a function of people:
                one input (a person) can lead to two different outputs
                (phone numbers).
                We also can't view people as a function of phone numbers,
                since more than one person can be associated with a phone number,
                such as when a family shares a single phone at home.

    <title>Real-world Examples of Functions</title>
    <p>
      Let's take a closer look at two of the functions described in Example <xref ref="ex_functionexamples" autoname="yes"/> in order to get a sense of how functions can be used in the real-world.
    </p>
    <example>

          Consider again the function defined by the relationship between the circumference of a circle and its diameter.
          The circumference of a circle is
          <em>directly proportional</em>
          to the diameter of the circle,
          meaning that the ratio of the two quantities is a constant value.
          The ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle<fn>
          Chinese mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–501) estimated the value of <m>\pi</m> by calculating the value of the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
          His approximation was <m>355/113</m>.
          Other historical mathematicians independently estimated <m>\pi</m> using the ratio of the area and radius of a circle.
          The ancient Babylonians (ca. 1900–1680 BC) estimated <m>\pi</m> as <m>3.125</m>.
          On the Rhind Papyrus (ca.1650 BC), Egyptian mathematicians recorded the value of <m>\pi</m> as 3.1605.
          Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC) showed that <m>\pi</m> is between
          <m>3\frac{1}{7}</m> and <m>3\frac{10}{71}</m>.

          </fn> happens to be the constant value <m>\pi</m>,
          so we can write this relationship explicitly as
          <me>
            \frac{C}{d}=\pi
          </me>
          where <m>C</m> represents the circumference and <m>d</m> is the diameter.
          If we choose to make <m>C</m> the
          <em>dependent variable</em>
          and <m>d</m> the <em>independent variable</em>,
          we can rewrite this relationship so that <m>C</m> is a function of <m>d</m>:
          <me>
            C=\pi d
          </me>.
          Given the diameter of a circle,
          you can find its circumference by multiplying by <m>\pi</m>.

          We know that the volume is increasing steadily and so contains <em>all values</em>
          between 0 and <m>3.75</m>,
          and no values outside that range,
          during the time frame from <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=5</m>.
          These are significant assumptions that come from our knowledge of the physical setting of the problem!
          Based on this deeper interpretation,
          we can say that on a domain of <m>t</m> between 0 and 5 minutes,
          the range for <m>V</m> is from 0 to <m>3.75</m> ft<m>^3</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Interval Notation for Sets</title>
    <p>
      When we talk about functions,
      they will always take some set of numbers as their domain and have some set of numbers as their range.
      In this section,
      we talk briefly about what a "set" is and some different notations for how to write them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have already seen one mathematical shorthand for a commonly used set:
      <m>\mathbb{R}</m> denotes the set of all real numbers.
      Another useful notation is the <em>empty set</em>:
      <m>\emptyset</m> denotes the set that contains nothing.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Please do not confuse <m>\emptyset</m> with the number 0.
        They are VERY different and should NOT be used interchangeably.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Another set we discussed was the domain and range of the water in the tank in Example <xref ref="ex_tablefunction" autoname="yes"/>.
      We said that if the time <m>t</m> is between 0 and 5 minutes,
      then the volume <m>V</m> was between 0 and <m>3.75</m> ft<m>^3</m>.
      We can write these using inequalities:
      <me>
        0\leq t\leq 5 \qquad\text{ and } \qquad 0\leq V \leq 3.75
      </me>,
      which are read "0 is less than or equal to <m>t</m>,
      which is less than or equal to 5" and "0 is less than or equal to <m>V</m>,
      which is less than or equal to <m>3.75</m>." An alternate notation for writing these two sets is called
      <em>interval notation</em>.
      The set <m>0\leq t \leq 5</m> is written
      <me>
        [0,5]
      </me>
      and the set <m>0\leq V\leq 3.75</m> is written
      <me>
        [0,3.75]
      </me>.
      This notation is nice and concise,
      but does not specify a variable and so can be confusing or ambiguous.
      If we wish to name the variable <m>t</m>,
      we would write <m>t\in[0,5]</m>,
      read "<m>t</m> is in the set of numbers from 0 (inclusive) to 5 (inclusive)." Likewise for <m>V</m>,
      we can write <m>V\in[0,3.75]</m>,
      read "<m>V</m> is in the set of numbers from 0 (inclusive) to 3.75 (inclusive)." The symbol <m>\in</m> means "in" and the square brackets indicate the the endpoints of the interval are included.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other sets that you saw were the domain and range of the function
      <m>g(x) = \sqrt{4-x}</m> in <xref ref="ex_introsqrt">Example</xref>.
      The range <m>y\geq 0</m> can be written in interval notation as <m>y\in [0,\infty)</m>.
      The domain <m>x\leq 4</m> can be written in interval notation as <m>x\in (-\infty,4]</m>.
      The meaning of this set is best illustrated on a number line:

</latex-image>
    </image>
    <p>
      The values of <m>x</m> are allowed to be any number below <m>x=4</m>,
      denoted by the open parentheses and <m>-\infty</m> on the left of the interval <m>(-\infty,4]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another set that you saw was the domain of the function <m>h</m> in Example <xref ref="ex_graphfunction" autoname="yes"/>.
      We wrote this using the standard shorthand of <m>x\neq -2,2</m>,
      which means that <m>x</m> can take on any value except for <m>-2</m> and <m>2</m>.
      To write this using inequalities,
      we would need three different parts:
      <me>
        x\lt -2\text{ or }  -2\lt x\lt 2\text{ or }  2\lt x
      </me>.
      The corresponding interval notation also has three parts:
      <me>
        (-\infty,-2)\cup(-2,2)\cup(2,\infty)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The round parentheses mean we do not include the endpoints at <m>-2</m> and <m>2</m>,
      and <m>\cup</m> is the "union" symbol,
      which means we are glueing the intervals together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, one more standard notation is an alternate way of writing the set of all real numbers:
      instead of writing <m>\mathbb{R}</m>,
      we can write <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.
      There is no way to write the empty set
      <m>\emptyset</m> using interval notation; WeBWorK will typically have you enter the word "none" in cases where there is no solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a table summarizing all of the above examples,
      along with a few more to help you understand when to use "<m>(</m>" vs. "<m>[</m>" and how to incorporate "<m>\cup</m>".

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    function, set <m>\mathbb{R}</m> of all real numbers, domain, range, function notation, independent variable, dependent variable, graph,  directly proportional, interval notation, the empty set <m>\emptyset</m>
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> A relationship or process is a function if each individual input is associated with one and only one output.
      This is represented visually on graphs via the Vertical Line Test.
      There are four different ways to represent a function
      (words, formula, table, graph).
      The domain of a function is the set of all inputs with a defined output.
      The range of a function is the set of all realized outputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em><fn>
      You do not have to understand them now and likely have many questions about them.
      We will work on these ideas much more over the next few sections.
      </fn> interval notation will become a convenient way to represent sets of numbers,
      the inside of a square root cannot be negative and the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero,
      the range of a function is not easy to find without a graph or table.
