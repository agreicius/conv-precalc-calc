    <title>Limits at Infinity of Power Functions</title>
    <p>
      In the last section,
      we saw a method for evaluating one form of indeterminate limit:
      limits of the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
      In this section,
      we begin to see how to calculate limits of the other indeterminate forms that algebraic functions can have:
      limits of the form <m>\infty-\infty</m>,
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>, and <m>0\cdot\infty</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin by examining limits at infinity of power functions with integer exponents.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Recall from the graphs of <m>f(x) = x^2</m> and
          <m>f(x) = x^3</m> in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage52a" autoname="yes"/> that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to\infty}x^2 = \infty\text{ and }  \lim_{x\to\infty}x^3 = \infty
          </me>
          while
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to-\infty}x^2 = \infty\text{ and }  \lim_{x\to-\infty}x^3 = -\infty
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This becomes clear if we think of
          <m>x\to\infty</m> as meaning that <m>x</m> is a larger and larger positive number,
          so that both <m>x^2</m> and <m>x^3</m> also become larger and larger,
          and are positive.
          Meanwhile, we can understand
          <m>x\to-\infty</m> as meaning that <m>x</m> is a larger and larger
          <em>negative</em> number,
          so that <m>x^2</m> is a larger and larger
          <em>positive</em> number,
          while <m>x^3</m> is a larger and larger
          <em>negative</em> number.

      This logic holds in general for any positive integer power of <m>x</m>:

      <title>Limits of Positive Integer Power Functions at Infinity</title>

                then <m>\ds\lim_{x\to-\infty}x^k = \infty</m>.

    <p>
      Recall that the above Theorem <xref ref="thm_pospowerfuncsatinfinity" autoname="yes"/> is
      <em>not</em> true for <em>negative</em>
      integer powers of <m>x</m>.
      For example, we have seen that
      <me>
        \lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{1}{x^2} = 0\text{ and } \lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{1}{x^3} = 0
      </me>
      since when we divide 1 by a larger and larger number,
      either positive or negative,
      the resulting fraction will become smaller and smaller,
      and so approach 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      This logic holds in general for any negative integer power of <m>x</m>:

      We can use the results of Theorem <xref ref="thm_pospowerfuncsatinfinity" autoname="yes"/> and Theorem <xref ref="thm_negpowerfuncsatinfinity" autoname="yes"/> along with the limit rules in <xref ref="thm_limitrules">Theorem</xref>
      to compute limits at infinity for sums of such terms.

    <title>Limits at Infinity of Polynomial Functions</title>
    <p>
      Let's now consider limits at <m>\infty</m> and <m>-\infty</m> for general polynomials:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We know that <m>\ds\lim_{x\to \infty}x^2 = \infty</m> and <m>\ds\lim_{x\to \infty}x^3 = \infty</m>,
          but what about
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to \infty}x^2-x^3?
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We would like to be able to split up this limit:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to \infty}x^2-x^3 = \left(\lim_{x\to\infty} x^2\right) - \left(\lim_{x\to\infty} x^3\right) = \infty-\infty
          </me>.
          However, this is not possible because neither of the limits involved in the expression exist;
          remember that the limit rules in <xref ref="thm_limitrules">Theorem</xref>
          that allow us to distribute limits over sums rely on the (finite) existence of the limits involved.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The limit <m>\ds\lim_{x\to \infty}x^2-x^3</m> is an example of a limit that has the indeterminate <em>limit form</em>
      <m>\mathbf{\infty-\infty}</m>.
      Similar to how we cannot cancel <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> and get <m>1</m>,
      <m>\infty</m> is not a number and we cannot simply cancel <m>\infty-\infty</m> and get 0.
      Recall that we call such limits "indeterminate" because they may be finite
      (either zero or nonzero)
      or infinite, as we shall see shortly.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We could factor the expression <m>x^2-x^3</m> by dividing out <m>x^2</m> from both terms:
          <me>
            x^2-x^3 = x^2(1-x)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now when we take the limit, we have
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to\infty} x^2-x^3 = \lim_{x\to\infty} x^2(1-x) = (\infty)(-\infty) = -\infty
          </me>
          since the product of two very large numbers will be very large,
          and if one number is positive while the other is negative,
          the product will be negative.
          This also makes sense if we consider the fact that <m>x^3</m> will get larger faster than <m>x^2</m>,
          so that the expression <m>x^2-x^3</m> will become be overwhelmed by the <m>x^3</m> term for large values of <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          On the other hand,
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to-\infty} x^2-x^3 =  \left(\lim_{x\to-\infty} x^2\right) - \left(\lim_{x\to-\infty} x^3\right) = \infty-(-\infty) = \infty+\infty
          </me>,
          which is NOT indeterminate,
          since we can understand the last expression as adding two large,
          positive numbers,
          which results in an even larger positive number, hence:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to-\infty} x^2-x^3 = \infty+\infty = \infty
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let's see one more example of evaluating a polynomial at <m>\infty</m> and <m>-\infty</m> before trying to generalize a rule to use for all limits at infinity of polynomial functions:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_quarticinfinitelimit">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The polynomial <m>f(x) = x^4-x^3-11x^2+9x+18</m> cannot be factored by dividing through by any common terms.
          However, we can "force" it to factor by dividing a factor of <m>x^4</m> from every term,
          which leaves negative powers of <m>x</m> in all but the leading term:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}f(x) \amp  = x^4-x^3-11x^2+9x+18 \\ \amp = x^4\left(1-x^{-1}-11x^{-2}+9x^{-3}+18x^{-4}\right) \\ \amp = x^4\left(1-\frac{1}{x}-\frac{11}{x^2}+\frac{9}{x^3}+\frac{18}{x^4}\right). \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Having done this, we can now evaluate the limits at infinity,
          recalling that the limits of the terms with negative powers of <m>x</m> will now go to 0:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to \infty}f(x) \amp = \lim_{x\to \infty}x^4\left(1-\frac{1}{x}-\frac{11}{x^2}+\frac{9}{x^3}+\frac{18}{x^4}\right)\\ \amp =\infty(1-0-0+0+0) \\ \amp =\infty \end{aligned}
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x) \amp = \lim_{x\to -\infty}x^4\left(1-\frac{1}{x}-\frac{11}{x^2}+\frac{9}{x^3}+\frac{18}{x^4}\right)\\ \amp =\infty(1-0-0+0+0) \\ \amp =\infty \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that the only term which ended up being relevant in the limit calculation was the leading term.
          Again, this makes sense since the leading term has the highest power,
          which will overwhelm the smaller terms for very large values of <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      All of these examples suggest the following method,
      which tells us that in order to evaluate limits at infinity of polynomial functions,
      we must "force-factor" the highest power of <m>x</m>:
    </p>
    <p>
      \fbox{<em>Evaluating <m>\infty-\infty</m> limits via force-factoring:</em>
      If <m>f</m> is a polynomial function of degree <m>n</m>,

      <m>\ds\lim_{x\to\pm\infty} f(x)</m> of the form <m>\infty-\infty</m>:

            <em>Force-factor</em> <m>f(x)</m> by factoring out <m>x^n</m>,

            The "forced" common factor of <m>x^n</m> is pulled out,
            and multiplied by the result of dividing all terms of the polynomial by <m>x^n</m>.
            If <m>f(x) = a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_0</m>,
            then we can rewrite the divided terms either with negative powers of <m>x</m> or as fractions with powers of <m>x</m> in the denominator:
            <me>
              \begin{aligned}f(x) \amp = a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_0\\ \amp = x^n\left(a_n+a_{n-1}x^{-1}+\ldots+a_0x^{-n}\right) \amp = x^n\left(a_n+a_{n-1}\frac{1}{x}+\ldots+a_0\frac{1}{x^n}\right) \end{aligned}

            Note that all terms in <m>\left(a_n+a_{n-1}\frac{1}{x}+\ldots+a_0\frac{1}{x^n}\right)</m> except for the first <m>a_n</m> now have powers of <m>x</m> in the denominator.
            These are negative powers of <m>x</m>,

            Only the power <m>x^n</m> and the leading coefficient <m>a_n</m> of <m>f(x)</m> will be nonzero,

    <title>Limits at Infinity of Rational Functions</title>
    <p>
      Now, we broaden our examination of limits at infinity to include rational functions.
      We have already seen that power functions with negative integer exponents have limits that approach 0 at infinity:
      <me>
        \lim_{x\to\pm\infty}x^{-k} = \lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{1}{x^k} = 0
      </me>
      since the denominator approaching
      <m>\pm\infty</m> will cause the entire fraction to approach 0.
      This same logic can be generalized to any fraction with a finite,
      nonzero numerator and infinite denominator:

          As <m>x\to\infty</m>, we know that

          <m>\frac{1}{x+1}\to 0</m>.
          We can write this as a one-line computation that shows our thought process:

          As <m>x</m> grows larger,
          the quantity <m>\frac{x}{2x-1}</m> appears to approach <m>0.5 = \frac{1}{2}</m>,
          so assuming that the pattern in the table continues for even larger values of <m>x</m>,
          we can conjecture that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x}{2x-1} = \frac{1}{2}
          </me>

      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      How can we approach such a limit algebraically,
      rather than using a table?
      One method is to divide both the numerator and denominator by powers of <m>x</m> so that the limit is no longer indeterminate.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Rewrite the indeterminate limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x}{2x-1} = \frac{\infty}{\infty}
          </me>
          from <xref ref="ex_basicHAexample">Example</xref>
          algebraically by dividing the numerator and denominator by <m>x</m> or,
          equivalently,
          multiplying the numerator and denominator by <m>1/x</m>,
          then simplifying:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x}{2x-1}\amp = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x}{2x-1}\cdot\frac{1/x}{1/x} \\ \amp =  \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{\frac{2x}{x}-\frac{1}{x}}\\ \amp =  \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{2-\frac{1}{x}} = \frac{1}{2-0} =\frac{1}{2} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This algebraic manipulation removes the indeterminate nature of the limit and we are able to finish the evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this algebraically-acquired answer of
          <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> matches the answer we conjectured via the table of values in <xref ref="ex_basicHAexample">Example</xref>.

          Visually, this limit describes a right horizontal asymptote at <m>y=\frac{1}{2}</m>,

      Let's examine some more limits of the form
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> arising from rational functions.

          Consider the function

        <p>
          We can begin to evaluate <m>\ds\lim_{x\to\infty} g(x)</m> and
          <m>\ds\lim_{x\to-\infty}g(x)</m> by evaluating the limits of the numerators and denominators separately,
          force-factoring when necessary.
          For the limit as <m>x\to\infty</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to\infty}7x^2+14x+7 \amp = \infty+\infty+7 = \infty\\ \text{ and }  \amp \\ \lim_{x\to\infty} x^2-2x+1 \amp = \infty-\infty+1\\ \amp  \text{ indeterminate, so force-factor } \\ \amp =  \lim_{x\to\infty} x^2(1-\frac{2}{x}+\frac{1}{x^2})\\ \amp = \infty\cdot(1-0+0) = \infty \end{aligned}

          This tells us that

            \lim_{x\to\infty}g(x) = \frac{\infty}{\infty}
          </me>,
          and so is indeterminate.

          </me>

          This tells us that

            \lim_{x\to-\infty}g(x) = \frac{\infty}{\infty}

          and so is also indeterminate.

        </p>
        <p>
          But how can we be sure about the value of either of these limits?
          We saw in the previous example that we may be able to use algebra to convert such limits from an indeterminate form to a non-indeterminate form.
          Here are two different algebraic methods for doing so
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><em>Method 1:</em></em> Divide the numerator and denominator by <m>x^2</m>.
          This is equivalent to multiplying the numerator and denominator by <m>1/x^2</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{7x^2+14x+7}{x^2-2x+1} \amp = \lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{7x^2+14x+7}{x^2-2x+1}\cdot\frac{1/x^2}{1/x^2}\\ \amp = \lim_{x\to \pm\infty}\frac{7+\frac{14}{x}+\frac{7}{x^2}}{1-\frac{2}{x}+\frac{1}{x^2}}\\ \amp = \frac{7+0+0}{1-0+0}\\ \amp = \frac{7}{1}\\ \amp =7 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><em>Method 2:</em></em> Force-factor <m>x^2</m> from both the numerator and denominator.
          The result is the same as in the previous method,
          since after factoring <m>x^2</m> from both the numerator and denominator,
          the <m>x^2</m>'s will cancel:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{7x^2+14x+7}{x^2-2x+1} \amp = \lim_{x\to \pm\infty}\frac{x^2\left(7+\frac{14}{x}+\frac{7}{x^2}\right)}{x^2\left(1-\frac{2}{x}+\frac{1}{x^2}\right)}\\ \amp = \lim_{x\to \pm\infty}\frac{7+\frac{14}{x}+\frac{7}{x^2}}{1-\frac{2}{x}+\frac{1}{x^2}}\\ \amp = \frac{7+0+0}{1-0+0}\\ \amp = \frac{7}{1}\\ \amp =7 \end{aligned}

        <p>
          It is no coincidence that both of these methods result in the same answer:
          <m>g(x)</m> has both right and left horizontal asymptotes at <m>y=7</m>,
          as we suspected from the numerical tables,
          and as shown below in <xref ref="fig_5-2Example2">Figure</xref>.
          Besides, mathematics should be consistent!
          Either of these methods provides a valid algebraic way of evaluating this limit,
          and you may choose to use whichever method you prefer.

          we see that <m>h(x)</m> does NOT have any horizontal asymptotes,
          since the limits as <m>x\to\infty</m> and <m>x\to-\infty</m> are not finite.

      \fbox{ <em>A technical note:</em>
      In Method 1, it is easier to divide through by the highest power of <m>x</m> that appears in the
      <em>denominator</em>, rather than overall.
      This will prevent you from arriving at a limit of the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>,
      which are are difficult to compute:
      we must determine the sign of the form
      <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> to see if the limit approaches <m>\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>.
      This detail is for convenience,
      rather than any mathematical rule.
      Dividing by the highest power of <m>x</m> that appears overall is not wrong,
      but it can sometimes result in a harder-than-necessary computation. }

    <p>
      Looking back at the results of Examples <xref ref="ex_5-2Example2" autoname="yes"/> and <xref ref="ex_5-2Example3" autoname="yes"/>,
      we realize that we should not be surprised by the results.
      In Example <xref ref="ex_5-2Example2" autoname="yes"/>,
      the numerator and denominator have the same degree,
      so it makes sense that they will grow at about the same rate and the resulting limit will be finite.
      In Example <xref ref="ex_5-2Example3" autoname="yes"/>,
      the numerator has a higher degree,
      so it makes sense that it will grow faster and the resulting limit will be infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is one last example for you to demonstrate these two methods for evaluating limits of the form <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>.
      In this example,
      note that the degree of the denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator.
      How can this observation help you to predict the value of the limit ahead of time?

    <title>Other Limit Forms</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The previous subsections have focused on indeterminate limits of the form
        <m>\infty-\infty</m> and <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>.
        For both forms,
        we have seen various algebraic methods that involve factoring for changing the form of the limit to one that is no longer indeterminate.
        When approaching an indeterminate limit,
        it's always a good idea to experiment with various algebraic manipulations and then reevaluate the limit to see if it is no longer indeterminate,
        or indeterminate of a type that you know how to deal with.
        Be warned that it takes a good deal of practice to be able to "see" ahead of time which manipulations will be effective.
        You may need to experiment and should approach limit calculations with patience and perseverance.
      </p>
      <example xml:id="ex_fractionVA">
        <statement>
          <p>
            For example, consider the limit
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{1}{x^4}
            </me>.
            Even though this limit is not being taken at infinity,
            it results in a limit of the form <m>\infty-\infty</m>:
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{1}{x^4} = \frac{1}{0^+}-\frac{1}{0^+} = \infty-\infty
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            We try to resolve this by using algebra via finding a common denominator:
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 0}\left(\frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{1}{x^4}\right) = \lim_{x\to 0}\left(\frac{x^2}{x^4}-\frac{1}{x^4}\right) =\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x^2-1}{x^4}  = \frac{0-1}{0^+} = \frac{-1}{0^+} = -\infty
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus we see that this limit describes a vertical asymptote that becomes infinitely negative to both the right and left of <m>x=0</m>,
            as illustrated in <xref ref="fig_fractionVA">Figure</xref>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Alternate solution:</em> Could we instead have approached this calculation in the same way as suggested for <m>\infty-\infty</m> limits:
            factor out the largest power of <m>x</m>?
            In this case the "largest" power is <m>x^{-2}</m>:
            <me>
              \frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{1}{x^4} = x^{-2}-x^{-4} = x^{-2}(1-x^{-2}) = \frac{1}{x^2}\left(1-\frac{1}{x^2}\right)
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Having done this, we can reevaluate the limit:
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{1}{x^4} = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1}{x^2}\left(1-\frac{1}{x^2}\right) = (\infty)(1-\infty) = (\infty)(-\infty) = -\infty
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            It worked!!!
          </p>
          <figure xml:id="fig_fractionVA">
            <caption><m>\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{1}{x^4}=-\infty</m> describes a vertical asymptote at <m>x=0</m> that approaches <m>-\infty</m> from the right and left.</caption>

        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>
        One last type of indeterminate limit that we have not yet addressed is the form <m>0\cdot\infty</m>.
        For algebraic functions,
        these can usually be resolved by simplifying the given expression:
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The limit
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to\infty}\left(\frac{1}{x}\cdot(x^2-1)\right) = 0\cdot \infty
            </me>
            is initially indeterminate,
            but simplifies easily by distributing and then is no longer indeterminate:
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to\infty}\left(\frac{1}{x}\cdot(x^2-1)\right) = \lim_{x\to\infty}\left(x-\frac{1}{x}\right) = \infty-0 = \infty
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            This limit tells us that there is no right horizontal asymptote for
            <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\cdot(x^2-1)</m> since the values of the function do not become finite as <m>x</m> grows without bound.

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Non-indeterminate Limit Forms</title>
      <p>
        Though we have been focused lately on difficult "indeterminate" limits,
        remember that many limits are not indeterminate and can be evaluated immediately,
        using a bit of intuition about the size of the quantities involved in the limit.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we can determine immediately whether a limit exists or not,
        then it is not an indeterminate limit.
        We have seen many non-indeterminate forms for limits already and summarize some of the most common the occur for algebraic functions in the theorem below.
        We will see more next semester when we explore transcendental functions.
      </p>
      <remark>
        <p>
          You should NOT memorize these limit forms or their values.
          Each of the limit forms in the theorem can be easily determined by investigation or intuition.
          In each case, there is no "fight" for the value of the limit;
          it is clear what limits of each form much approach.

            For example, in a limit of the form <m>\frac{0}{\infty}</m>,
            the numerator approaches zero,
            making the quotient smaller and smaller;
            at the same time, the denominator grows without bound,
            which also makes the quotient smaller and smaller.
            Thus for the form <m>\frac{0}{\infty}</m>,
            the behavior of both the numerator and the denominator causes the limit to approach 0.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following results were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    Limits at infinity of positive integer power function, of negative integer power functions, of polynomial functions, of rational functions.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> We can use algebra to change indeterminate limits of the forms
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>, <m>\infty-\infty</m>,
      and <m>0\cdot\infty</m> into non-indeterminate limit forms.
      There are often several methods that will work equally well,
      especially for limits of the form <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>,
      such as dividing through by the highest power of <m>x</m> in the denominator or force-factoring the numerator and denominator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      Evaluating limits requires patience.
      Indeterminate limits must be evaluated,
      manipulated, evaluated again,
      and then sometimes manipulated and evaluated some more until they are no longer indeterminate.
      DNE is never a sufficient answer to any limit problem without detailed explanation of why the limit does not exist!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there is a short-cut to finding horizontal asymptotes of rational functions.
      No, I will not tell you what it is
      (until next semester)
      and no, you can't use it if you know it.
      We'll do these types of limits via the algebraic methods presented for now.
