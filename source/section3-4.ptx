    <title>Definitions: Infinite Limits and Limits at Infinity</title>
    <p>
      The wonderful thing about continuity is that it lets us calculate limits by evaluation.
      But what are we supposed to do with the limits that we cannot just evaluate,
      such as at <m>x</m>-values that are not in the domain of a function?
      We begin to investigate with a simple example:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_VAmotivation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> is undefined when <m>x=0</m>,
          so the only limit of this function that we cannot calculate by simply plugging in is
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The graph of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> is in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage52binfinitelimit" autoname="yes"/> below:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_taalmanpage52binfinitelimit">
          <caption><m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> is undefined at <m>x=0</m>.</caption>
          <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage52b.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Based on <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage52binfinitelimit" autoname="yes"/>,
          you may be able to see what <m>\ds\lim_{x\to0}\frac{1}{x}</m> should be.
          In case it isn't clear to you,
          here is a table of values for
          <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> as <m>x\to 0</m> from both the left and right.

        <p>
          We can see that as <m>x\to 0^+</m>,
          the values of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> become larger and larger.
          We write this using limit notation as
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{1}{x} = \infty
          </me>.
          Similarly, we can see that as <m>x\to 0^-</m>,
          the values of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> become larger and larger,
          and are negative.
          We write this using limit notation as
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to0^-}\frac{1}{x} = -\infty
          </me>.
          Since the right and left limits do not agree,
          we cannot make any two-sided limit statement, other than to say that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x}\text{ DNE, because the right and left limits are not equal. }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This last answer is not particularly informative or useful,
          and so our REAL answer for the limit as <m>x\to 0</m> is to describe both the left and right limits as precisely as we can:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{1}{x} = \infty\text{ and }  \lim_{x\to0^-}\frac{1}{x} = -\infty
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Example <xref ref="ex_VAmotivation" autoname="yes"/> demonstrates the necessity of defining a notation that describes the values of a function becoming infinitely large,
      either positively or negatively.
      This is stated more carefully in Definition <xref ref="def_infinitelimit" autoname="yes"/> below:
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def_infinitelimit">
      <title>Definition of Infinite Limits</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a function <m>f</m> and a fixed input <m>x=c</m>,
          we say that <em><m>f</m> approaches infinity as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m></em> and write
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to c}f(x) = \infty
          </me>
          provided that we can make the values of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
          (but not equal)
          to <m>c</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, we say that <em><m>f</m> approaches negative infinity as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m></em> and write
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to c}f(x) = -\infty
          </me>
          provided that we can make the values of <m>f(x)</m> as large and negative as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
          (but not equal)
          to <m>c</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either of these statements can be modified appropriately for left and right limits.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      \fbox{ Recall that in Definition <xref ref="def_limit" autoname="yes"/>,
      a limit does not exist if there is no single value that <m>f(x)</m> approaches as <m>x\to c</m>.
      That is the case for <em>every</em> infinite limit:
      there is no finite value that the function approaches.
      Even though we write that the limit is "equal to" <m>\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>,
      these limits <em>do not exist</em>
      because <m>\infty</m> and <m>-\infty</m> are not real numbers. }
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_moreVAmotivation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can see from the graph of
          <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}</m> in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage301b-1verticalasymptote" autoname="yes"/> that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 0^-}\frac{1}{x^2} = \infty\text{ and }  \lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{1}{x^2} = \infty
          </me>
          so that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2} = \infty
          </me>.
          This means only that the values of
          <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m> become infinitely large as <m>x\to 0</m>.
          The limit still does not <em>exist</em>.
          However, we do NOT write <m>\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}</m> DNE because that does not give us any useful information.
          Remember: limits are used to describe the behavior of functions,
          not simply spit out an answer,
          so we want our answers to be as descriptive as possible.

      The graphs of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> and
      <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}</m> motivate another type of limit.
      Notice that the <m>y</m>-values of both functions approach the <m>x</m>-axis at the far left and right ends of the graph.
      There appears to be a particular "long-term" behavior for both functions that is worth describing.

          either positively or negatively,
          the values of both <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> and
          <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}</m> become smaller and smaller.

        <p>
          We can see that <m>\ds\lim_{x\to \infty} x^2 = \infty</m> and <m>\ds\lim_{x\to -\infty}x^2 = \infty</m> since the values of
          <m>f(x) = x^2</m> become large and are positive as <m>x</m> becomes large and is either positive or negative.
          If you're not sure what to look at on the graph,
          consider the values of <m>x^2</m> for <m>x=10, 100, 1000, \ldots</m>
          (meaning as <m>x\to\infty</m>)
          and for <m>x = -10, -100, -1000\ldots</m>
          (meaning as <m>x\to-\infty</m>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, we can see that
          <m>\ds\lim_{x\to \infty} x^3 = \infty</m> and <m>\ds\lim_{x\to -\infty}x^3 = -\infty</m>.
          This becomes clear if we think of
          <m>x\to\infty</m> as meaning that <m>x</m> is a larger and larger positive number,
          so that <m>x^3</m> also becomes larger and larger, and is positive.
          Meanwhile, we can understand
          <m>x\to-\infty</m> as meaning that <m>x</m> is a larger and larger
          <em>negative</em> number,
          so that <m>x^3</m> is a larger and larger
          <em>negative</em> number.
          For example,

            (-10)^3 = -1000, (-100)^3 = -1,000,000, (-1000)^3 = -1,000,000,000,\ldots

          As <m>x</m> approaches 1 from the left,
          the values of <m>\frac{x}{x-1}</m> are negative and are getting bigger and bigger
          (we expect the next few numbers to be -9999, -99999, etc.).
          On the other hand, as <m>x</m> approaches 1 from the right,
          the values of <m>\frac{x}{x-1}</m> are positive and are getting bigger and bigger
          (on this side,
          we expect the next few numbers to be 10001, 100001, etc.).
          The common feature is that the function is getting larger on both sides,
          one negative and one positive,
          and the function will continue to get bigger and bigger the closer and closer we get to 1.

    <title>Limits of the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m></title>
    <p>
      As we saw in Example <xref ref="ex_VAmotivation" autoname="yes"/> and Example <xref ref="ex_moreVAmotivation" autoname="yes"/> the graphs of <m>y= \frac{1}{x}</m> and
      <m>y= \frac{1}{x^2}</m> have vertical asymptotes at <m>x=0</m>.
      These two examples motivate a category of limits that "have the form
      <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>" and that result in vertical asymptotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we saw in Example <xref ref="ex_moreVAmotivation" autoname="yes"/> in the case of <m>y=\frac{1}{x^2}</m>,
      when the denominator approaches <m>0</m> and is positive,
      the limit will approach <m>\infty</m>.
      We denote this behavior as having the form
      <m>\frac{1}{0^+}</m> since the denominator is always positive.
      However, as we saw in Example <xref ref="ex_VAmotivation" autoname="yes"/> in the case of <m>y=\frac{1}{x}</m>,
      it is possible for the denominator to approach <m>0</m> and be positive on one side of the limit
      (which we denote by the form <m>\frac{1}{0^+}</m>)
      but approach <m>0</m> and be negative on the other side of the limit
      (which we denote by the form <m>\frac{1}{0^-}</m>).
      Thus with limits of the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>,
      it is necessary to determine whether the denominator is positive or negative on either side of the limit.
      Only then will we be able to determine whether the limit approaches <m>\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above discussion is summarized in Theorem <xref ref="thm_VAthm" autoname="yes"/> below:

          The above statements also apply to one-sided limits.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Of course, the numerator of the limit need not be exactly equal to 1.
      Any nonzero finite number divided by a very small number will become very large.
      For instance,
      <me>
        \frac{2}{0.000001} = 2,000,000
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ease of notation,
      we say that limits that evaluate to <m>\dfrac{\text{ "non-zero" } }{\text{ zero } }</m> have
      <em>the form <m>\mathbf{\frac{1}{0}}</m></em>,
      even though the numerator may be any nonzero number.
      As we shall see later,
      the sign of the numerator does have an influence on whether the overall limit is positive or negative,
      even though the size of the nonzero numerator does not matter.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_lengthyVAcalculation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{x}{3-x}
          </me>.
          Its domain is <m>x\neq 3</m> and so the only limit that we cannot compute by plugging in is <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 3}\frac{x}{3-x}</m>.
          If we do try to evaluate the limit by plugging in, we have
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 3}\frac{x}{3-x} = \frac{3}{0}
          </me>.
          As a value, this is undefined.
          However, we are attempting to describe the
          <em>behavior of the function</em> near <m>x=3</m>.
          Instead we recognize that this limit "has the form
          <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>" since its numerator approaches a non-zero number (3) and its denominator approaches zero.
          Thus we expect this limit to be infinite and to describe a vertical asymptote of <m>f(x) = \frac{x}{3-x}</m> at <m>x=3</m>.

        <p>
          In order to apply Theorem <xref ref="thm_VAthm" autoname="yes"/>,
          we need to determine whether the denominator approaches a small positive number or a small negative number.
          To accomplish this,
          we complete a brief sign analysis for the denominator <m>3-x</m>:

          We see that as <m>x\to 3^-</m>,
          the values of <m>x</m> are less than 3 while approaching <m>3</m>,
          hence that <m>3-x</m> is positive while approaching <m>0</m>.
          Thus we can calculate the left limit as:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 3^-}\frac{x}{3-x} = \frac{3}{0^+} = \infty
          </me>

        <p>
          Similarly, we see that as <m>x\to 3^+</m>,
          the values of <m>x</m> are greater than 3 while approaching 3, hence that <m>3-x</m> is negative while approaching <m>0</m>.
          Thus we can calculate the right limit as:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 3^+}\frac{x}{3-x} = \frac{3}{0^-} = -\infty

      How do we identify the value of <m>x=c</m> at which to look for a vertical asymptote?
      Recall that vertical asymptotes are also called infinite discontinuities.
      As long as we are working with algebraic functions,
      discontinuities occur only at points that are not in the domain of a function,
      and we are specifically interested in limits with denominators of zero.
      Therefore, we expect vertical asymptotes to occur only at the values of <m>x</m> for which the denominator of an algebraic function is equal to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      \fbox{<em>In order to determine whether an algebraic function has a vertical asymptote:</em>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            An algebraic function can only have a vertical asymptote if it can be written in the form of a fraction with a non-constant denominator.

      As we have seen, it is often
      (but not always)
      necessary to evaluate a limit of the form
      <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> using separate right and left limits.
      The key observation is whether the denominator changes sign at the <m>x</m>-value where it is equal to zero.

          It is positive for <m>x\lt 3</m> and negative for <m>x>3</m>.

          We know this because even powers of an expression cannot be negative.

    <p>
      Once we know whether to use separate right and left limits,
      we evaluate the sign of the rest of the expression in the limit to determine whether the limit goes to positive or negative infinity.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the function <m>f(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x+1}}</m> likely has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=-1</m> since that is where the denominator is equal to 0.
          Note as well that <m>\sqrt{x+1}</m> is undefined for <m>x\lt -1</m> since we must have
          <m>x+1\geq 0</m> inside the square root.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evaluating the limit from the right only,
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to -1^+}\frac{x}{\sqrt{x+1}} = \frac{-1}{0^+}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The denominator is positive and the numerator is negative,
          hence the fraction is negative overall for values of <m>x</m> near <m>-1</m>.
          Thus we conclude that the values of the expression become very large and are negative,
          which we summarize using limit notation as
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to -1^+}\frac{x}{\sqrt{x+1}} = -\infty

        <p>
          From this table,
          we might conclude that the limit approaches <m>0.2</m>.
          We can't tell whether this number is precise,
          but we can tell that the limit does approach a finite number,
          rather than becoming infinite.
          Thus if we conclude that <m>h(x)</m> does not have a vertical asymptote at <m>x=3</m>,
          we are still correct,
          even though we do not yet know the precise value of the limit at <m>x=3</m>.<fn>
          We'll cover that in the next section,
          but I think we can all agree that this section is long enough already.
          </fn>

        <p>
          We can confirm from a graph that there are only the two vertical asymptotes of this function at <m>x=\pm2</m>:

        <p>
          Determine where <m>x^3+2x^2+x</m> is equal to zero.
          Then use this to determine where
          <m>g(x) = \dfrac{5}{x^3+2x^2+x}</m> may have vertical asymptotes and whether you need separate right and left limits to determine the precise behavior of the function at each limit
          (whether it approaches <m>\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>).

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    infinite limit, limit at infinity, infinite limit at infinity; vertical asymptote, horizontal asymptote; limits of the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Limits that have infinite <m>y</m>-values for finite <m>x</m>-values are called vertical asymptotes.
      Limits that have finite <m>y</m>-values for infinite <m>x</m>-values are called horizontal asymptotes.
      Limits of the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> are always infinite,
      and often need to be computed separately from the left and right to determine whether the limit is positive or negative from either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      We still have a long way to go to be able to calculate limits algebraically.
      We do not yet know how to calculate limits at infinity,
      except in very simple cases.
      We also do not yet know how to manage limits that evaluate to <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
