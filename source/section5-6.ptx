    <title>Inflection Points: Where Concavity Changes</title>
    <p>
      We begin by reviewing the type of information we can determine using the first and second derivatives,
      and see two more characterizations of concavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall how the sign of the first derivative
      (<xref ref="thm_firstderivativeinfo">Theorem</xref>)
      and the definition of concavity
      (<xref ref="def_concavity">Definition</xref>)
      give us information about the shape of a function:

      From the First Derivative Test
      (<xref ref="thm_firstderivativetest">Theorem</xref>),
      a change in the sign of the first derivative at a critical point indicates a local extrema,
      a.k.a. a local maximum or minimum (for a function <m>f(x)</m> that is continuous and differentiable near <m>x=c</m>):

      There is also a special name for the points on the curve at which the second derivative changes sign:
      <em>inflection points</em>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>x=c</m> is a value in the domain of a continuous function <m>f(x)</m> at which <m>f(x)</m> changes concavity,
          then we say that <m>(c,f(c))</m> is an
          <em>inflection point</em>
          or <em>point of inflection</em> of <m>f</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Just as we look for locations where <m>f</m> changes from increasing to decreasing at points where <m>f'(c)=0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> is undefined,
      so too we find where <m>f''(c)=0</m> or <m>f''(c)</m> is undefined to see if there are points of inflection at these locations.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, consider the function <m>f(x) = x^3</m>.
          Calculating the first two derivatives,
          <me>
            f'(x) = 3x^2 \text{ and }   f''(x) = 6x
          </me>.
          <m>f''(x)=6x=0</m> only when <m>x=0</m> and is defined for all <m>x</m>-values,
          hence <m>f''(x)</m> can only change sign at <m>x=0</m>.

          we see the sign of <m>f''</m> changes from negative to positive at <m>x=0</m>,
          and therefore the concavity of <m>f</m> changes from down to up at <m>x=0</m>.
          Hence <m>x=0</m> is an inflection point of <m>f(x)</m>. (It is also correct to say that <m>x=0</m> is a critical point for <m>f'(x)</m> since the derivative of <m>f'(x)</m> is equal to zero at <m>x=0</m>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see this on the graph of <m>f(x)=x^3</m> below,
          where the function changes from concave down to concave up at the point <m>(0,0)</m>.
        </p>

    <p>
      Here is another interesting characterization of concavity:
      when a function is concave up,
      the tangent lines are below the curve,
      while when a function is concave down,
      the tangent lines are above the curve.
      At an inflection point, the tangent line will pass through the curve,
      and will be above on one side of the point of inflection and below on the other side of the point of inflection.
      This sometimes helps people see inflection points more easily on the graph of a function.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, we can see on the graph of
          <m>f(x)=x^3</m> below that at <m>x=0</m>,
          the tangent line to the graph passes through the curve.
          To the left of <m>x=0</m>, the tangent lines are above the curve,
          while to the right of <m>x=0</m>,
          the tangent lines are below the curve:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <caption>Tangent lines to <m>f(x)=x^3</m> are above the curve for <m>x\lt 0</m>, below the curve for <m>x>0</m>, and pass through the curve at <m>x=0</m>.</caption>

      If <m>x=c</m> is an inflection point of <m>f</m> and <m>f''(c)=0</m>,
      then the graph of <m>f</m> could look one of the following four ways near <m>x=c</m>,
      depending on how <m>f</m> changes concavity and whether <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing:

    </figure>
    <p>
      Here is one last interpretation of inflection points in terms of the shape of the graph of <m>f'(x)</m>.
      We know that at an inflection point of a function <m>f</m>,
      the function changes concavity and the second derivative <m>f''</m> changes sign.
      What happens to the first derivative <m>f'</m>?
      The answer lies in the fact that the second derivative <m>f''</m> is the derivative of the first derivative <m>f'</m>.
      Thus if we know that if <m>f''</m> is positive,
      then <m>f'</m> is increasing,
      and if <m>f''</m> is negative then <m>f'</m> is decreasing.
      (Recall <xref ref="def_concavity">Definition</xref>.)
      Hence when the concavity of <m>f(x)</m> changes and <m>f''(x)</m> changes sign,
      the first derivative <m>f'(x)</m> has either a local minimum or maximum.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Below is the graph of <m>f(x)=x^3</m> in blue,
          <m>f'(x)=3x^2</m> in red, and <m>f''(x)=6x</m> in green.
          We can see that when <m>f''(x) = 6x</m> changes sign from negative to positive,
          not only does <m>f(x) = x^3</m> change concavity,
          but also <m>f'(x) = 3x^2</m> has a local minimum.
        </p>

      In the examples that follow,
      we use information from the first and second derivatives to sketch reasonably accurate graphs of functions.
      For now, we will include the following important features of a graph,
      though we will be adding to this list in the next two sections:

                This derivative is always defined and continuous,

                Thus we see that <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>x=-1</m>,
                where <m>f'</m> changes from positive to negative,
                and a local minimum at <m>x=1</m>,
                where <m>f'</m> changes from negative to positive.
                <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>(-\infty,-1)\cup(1,\infty)</m> and decreasing on <m>(-1,1)</m>.
                The local maximum at <m>x=-1</m> has <m>y</m>-value <m>y=f(-1) = (-1)^3-3(-1)+2 = 4</m>,
                so the point where the maximum occurs is <m>(-1,4)</m>.
                The local minimum at <m>x=1</m> has <m>y</m>-value <m>y=f(1) = (1)^3-3(1)+2 = 0</m>,
                so the point where the minimum occurs is <m>(1,0)</m>.
                Note that we have found one of the <m>x</m>-intercepts that we could not find directly via factoring!
                This is a happy coincidence.

                Moving on to the second derivative,
                we have <m>f''(x) = 6x</m>.
                This is zero when <m>x=0</m> and is never undefined.

                Thus we see that <m>f</m> has an inflection point at <m>x=0</m>,
                where <m>f''</m> changes from negative to positive.
                <m>f</m> is concave down on
                <m>(-\infty,0)</m> and concave up on <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
                The inflection point at <m>x=0</m> has <m>y</m>-value <m>y=f(0) = (0)^3-3(0)+2 = 2</m>,
                so the point where the graph changes concavity is <m>(0,2)</m>.
                This also happens to be the <m>y</m>-intercept of the function
                (though that is a coincidence).

          Having determined intercepts,
          local minima and maxima, and inflection points,
          we begin to sketch <m>f(x)</m> by plotting the points we have identified,
          along with some suggestive bits of curves according to whether they are extrema or inflection points:

          We can now connect these points with a reasonably-shaped graph,
          keeping track of which of the four shapes of graphs we should use between each of the points:

          Next, the function is decreasing and concave down on the interval <m>(-1,0)</m> until the point <m>(0,2)</m>.
          On the next interval <m>(0,1)</m>,
          the function continues to decreasing but is concave up until the point <m>(1,0)</m>.

        Recall that in Example <xref ref="introcurvesketch1" autoname="yes"/> we found an <m>x</m>-intercept by chance when finding the local minimum at <m>x=1</m>.
        It looks from the graph that <m>x=1</m> is actually a double zero,
        and that there is another <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x=-2</m>.
        We can confirm this by expanding the expression
        <m>(x+2)(x-1)^2</m> that corresponds to this configuration of <m>x</m>-intercepts and seeing that it is equal to the function <m>f(x) = x^3-3x+2</m>:
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}(x+2)(x-1)^2 \amp = (x+2)(x^2-2x+1)\\ \amp = x(x^2-2x+1)+2(x^2-2x+1)\\ \amp = (x^3-2x^2+x)+(2x^2-4x+2)\\ \amp = x^3-3x+2 \end{aligned}

        Amazing!
        A task that we were initially unable to complete by hand (factoring
        <m>f(x) = x^3-3x+2</m>) was made possible by graphing the function.
        This is <em>not</em> a common occurrence,
        because most functions do not have "nice" <m>x</m>-intercepts.
        However, it <em>is</em> common to use the graph of a function to
        <em>estimate</em> <m>x</m>-intercepts,
        which can then be approximated to whatever degree of precision is desired via a numerical method,
        such as the Bisection Method introduced in Expansion Project #3.

      The next two functions we will sketch by hand are
      <m>g(x) = x^{1/3}</m> and <m>h(x) = x^{2/3}</m>.
      It is actually great if you have no memory of what these functions look like since that will give you more practice in working from first and second derivative information.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider <m>g(x) = x^{1/3}</m>

              <p>
                <m>g(x) = x^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{x}</m> is defined for all real numbers.
                (Yes, we can take the cube root of a negative number.
                For example <m>\sqrt[3]{-1} = -1</m>.)
                Hence the domain of <m>g(x)</m> is <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.

                The <m>y</m>-intercept found in part (b) is also an <m>x</m>-intercept,
                and is in fact the only <m>x</m>-intercept since

                  \begin{aligned}\sqrt[3]{x} \amp = 0\\ x \amp = 0^3 = 0 \end{aligned}

                </me>.
                We can see that <m>g'(x)</m> is undefined at <m>x=0</m>,
                which is a critical point since it is in the domain of the function.

                <m>h(x) = x^{2/3} = \sqrt[3]{x^2}</m> is defined for all real numbers.

                The <m>y</m>-intercept found in part (b) is also an <m>x</m>-intercept,

                </me>.
                We can see that <m>h'(x)</m> is undefined at <m>x=0</m>,
                which is a critical point since it is in the domain of the function.
                Creating a number line for <m>h'(x)</m> and plugging in points:

                we see that <m>h(x)</m> is decreasing on
                <m>(-\infty,0)</m> and increasing on <m>(0,\infty)</m>,
                so that <m>x=0</m> is a local minimum.
                The <m>y</m>-value of the minimum point is <m>y=h(0) = \sqrt[3]{0^2} = 0</m>.
                The minimum point   <m>(0,0)</m> is the same as the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-intercepts found in parts (b) and (c).

                we see that <m>h(x)</m> is concave down on both
                <m>(-\infty,0)</m> and on <m>(0,\infty)</m>,

        This is indeed the case if we look at the derivative

    <title>Sketching from Only Derivative Information</title>
    <p>
      The first and second derivatives capture the shape of a function,
      and so it is possible to sketch a graph of functions directly from their derivatives without knowing the formula for the function itself.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Below is the sign chart for the first and second derivatives of a mystery function <m>f(x)</m>.
          Sketch a possible graph of the function,
          assuming that it is both continuous and differentiable for all <m>x</m>,
          and that each tick mark is where the first or second derivative is equal to 0.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <image width="56%" source="Taalman3-3Ex48.png"/>
        </figure>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can see that the first derivative changes sign at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
          Since it changes from negative to positive at <m>x=-1</m>,
          this is a local minimum.
          Since it changes from positive to negative at <m>x=2</m>,
          this is a local maximum.
          We cannot determine the <m>y</m>-values of the function at these two points,
          but we can infer from the "maximum/minimum" designations that the <m>y</m>-value at <m>x=2</m> is higher than the <m>y</m>-value at <m>x=-1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second derivative changes sign at <m>x=0.5</m>,
          making this an inflection point.
          Again, we do not know the <m>y</m>-value of this point.
          However, since it is NOT a minimum or maximum,
          it must be between the <m>y</m>-values of the points at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
          We could begin to sketch these points in approximate positions,
          as shown below:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <caption>The graph has a local maximum at <m>x=2</m>, a local minimum at <m>x=-1</m>, and an inflection point at <m>x=0.5</m>. The <m>y</m>-values of the points are arbitrary, except for their relative locations to each other.</caption>
          <image width="75%" source="DerivativeSketchPoints.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Collecting the first and second derivative information for the intervals between these points can be useful:

      Now that we have some practice graphing a function based only on the signs of the first and second derivatives,
      let's revisit a task that you saw on Homework #7:
      sketching the graph of a function given the graph of its derivative.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_graphingfromsignchart">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>g(x)</m> be a function whose derivative <m>g'(x)</m> is shown in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage240a" autoname="yes"/>:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_TaalmanPage240a">
          <caption>The graph of the derivative <m>g'(x)</m>.</caption>
          <image width="46%" source="TaalmanPage240a.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Since the derivative <m>g'(x)</m> is positive for <m>x\lt -1</m>,
          we know that the function <m>g(x)</m> must be increasing for <m>x\lt -1</m>.
          Because the derivative <m>g'(x)</m> has a zero at <m>x=-1</m> and switches to negative,
          we know that the function <m>g(x)</m> must have a local maximum at <m>x=-1</m> and decrease from <m>x=-1</m> to <m>x=2</m>.
          The derivative <m>g'(x)</m> is positive for <m>x>2</m>,
          so the function <m>g(x)</m> is increasing for <m>x>2</m>.
          The open dots on the graph at <m>x=2</m> tell us that the derivative is undefined at <m>x=2</m>,
          so <m>g(x)</m> is not differentiable at <m>x=2</m>,
          but we do not know in what way <m>g(x)</m> fails to be differentiable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking of things we <em>do not know</em>,
          we are missing the following information about the function <m>g(x)</m>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The precise <m>y</m>-values of any points on the graph.
                In particular,
                we cannot determine any <m>x</m>- or <m>y</m>-intercepts from the sign chart of <m>g'(x)</m>,
                nor do we know the <m>y</m>-values of any local maximum or minimum points.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Whether the function <m>g(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=2</m> or not.
                Since the derivative <m>g'(x)</m> exists for all other <m>x</m>-values,
                we know that the function <m>g(x)</m> must be differentiable,
                hence continuous, at all <m>x</m>-values other than <m>x=2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the shape of <m>g'(x)</m>,
          we can infer that <m>g</m> is a parabola for <m>x\lt 2</m> (since <m>g'(x)</m> is linear for <m>x\lt 2</m>) and that <m>g(x)</m> is a linear function for <m>x>2</m> (since <m>g'(x)</m> is constant for <m>x>2</m>).
          Here is <em>one possible graph</em>
          of the function <m>g</m>,
          assuming that <m>g(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=2</m> (so the graph must have a corner at that point):

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    Inflection points.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Inflection points are where the concavity of a graph changes.
      They are also where the first derivative has a local maximum or minimum.
      We can use first and second derivative information,
      along with the four shapes of nonlinear functions,
      to play "connect-the-dots" between intercepts,
      local minima and maxima, and inflection points, on a graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced/introduced:</em>
      If we are not given an explicit function,
      we cannot determine precise <m>y</m>-values for points on the graph of the function.
      However, we can still sketch a remarkably accurate graph of a function based only on the first,
      and maybe also second, derivatives.
