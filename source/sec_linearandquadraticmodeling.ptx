    <title>The Mathematical Modeling Process</title>
    <p>
      A <em>mathematical model</em> is a mathematical description
      (often by means of a function or an equation)
      of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population,
      the demand for a product,
      the speed of a falling object,
      the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction,
      the life expectancy of a person at birth,
      or the cost of emission reductions.
      The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about future behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig_modeling_cycle" autoname="yes"/> below illustrates the process of mathematical modeling.

    <p>
      Given a real-world problem,
      our first task is to formulate a mathematical problem by
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            identifying and naming the independent and dependent variables
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            making assumptions that simplify the problem so it is easy enough to describe with mathematics
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            using knowledge of the physical situation to brainstorm relevant equations,
            formulas,
            and theorems, possibly working from data or a graph
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            obtaining equations that relate the variables
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The second step is to apply the mathematics that we know
      (such as the calculus that we will be developing over the year)
      to the mathematical equations that we have formulated in order to derive a mathematical solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third step,
      we take those mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the original real-world phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions.
      The final step is to test our predictions by checking against new real data.
      If the predictions don't compare well with reality,
      we need to refine our model or formulate a new model and start the cycle over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is similar to the framework for problem-solving described in <xref ref="sec_problemsolving" autoname="yes"/>, except that in a truly real-world problem,
      the actual question may not be stated explicitly or formulated in a way that can be answered without further refinement of the question
      (getting more information,
      simplifying more assumptions, building more theory).
      Since we are working in the context of a calculus course,
      all of our "real-world" questions will be very well-behaved and tractable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical situation.
      Instead, it is an <em>idealization</em>
      or an <em>approximation</em>.
      A good model simplifies reality enough to permit mathematical calculations but is accurate enough to provide valuable conclusions.
      It is important to realize the limitations of the model.

    <title>Using Linear Functions as Models</title>
    <p>
      Since linear functions have a constant slope,
      linear functions perfectly model quantities that change at a constant rate.
      In context, we can often think of slope as a rate of change.
      Paying careful attention to units can help determine whether given information is a value of a variable or a rate of change.

      <title>Dolbear's Law</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          One example of a mathematical model is found in Dolbear's Law.<fn>
          You can read more in the
          <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolbear%27s_law">Wikipedia entry</url>
          for Dolbear's Law,
          which has proven to be remarkably accurate for the behavior of snowy tree crickets.
          For even more of the story,
          including a reference to this phenomenon on the popular show The Big Bang Theory, see
          <url href="https://priceonomics.com/how-to-tell-the-temperature-using-crickets/">this article</url>.
          </fn> In the late 1800s,
          the physicist Amos Dolbear was listening to crickets chirp and noticed a pattern:
          how frequently the crickets chirped seemed to be connected to the outside temperature.
          If we let <m>T</m> represent the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and <m>N</m> the number of chirps per minute,
          we can summarize Dolbear's observations in the following table.

        <p>
          For a mathematical model,
          we often seek an algebraic formula that captures observed behavior accurately and can be used to predict behavior not yet observed.
          When we graph the data,
          we can see a pattern that tells us what kind of formula to use:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_dolbear1">
          <caption>Graph of Dolbear's data and the underlying curve.</caption>
          <image width="56%" source="APCFigure1-2-3.pdf"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The data appear to fit a line.
          If we calculate the average rate of change between any two points,
          this should give us the slope of the line.
          Using the points <m>(40,50)</m> and <m>(80,60)</m>, we find
          <me>
            AV_{[40,80]} = \frac{60-50}{80-40} = \frac{10}{40} = 0.25
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using point-slope form with the point<fn>
          You could use the point <m>(80,60)</m> instead,
          or any of the other points.
          </fn> <m>(40,50)</m> and simplifying to slope-intercept form, we have
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}T \amp = 0.25(N-40)+50\\ T \amp = 0.25N-10+50\\ T \amp = 0.25N+40 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we attempt any further calculations,
          we may want to check that our model accurately represents the collected data.
          Let's check that the point
          <m>(120,70)</m> is indeed on the line.
          For <m>N=120</m>, we have
          <me>
            T=0.25(120)+40 = 30+40 = 70
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Success!
          Now that we have found a formula,
          and convinced ourselves that it's correct,<fn>
          If you are not convinced yet,
          think about how you could further verify that this model is accurate.
          </fn> let's give it a name.
          Let <m>D</m> be the name of our "Dolbear" function that takes <m>N</m> number of chirps per minute as inputs and gives <m>T</m> temperature in degrees Fahrenheit as outputs:

          \fbox{ Dolbear's function, <m>T = D(N) = 0.25N+40</m>,

          Now that we have a model for Dolbear's observations,

      <title>More about Dolbear's Law</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's continue to explore the limits of our model for Dolber's observations.
          Suppose we wish to know the number of chirps we should hear when the outside temperature is
          <m>35^\circ</m> F. There is no point on the graph with <m>T=35</m> and so we solve numerically for <m>N</m> to determine the number of chirps one should hear when the outside temperature is <m>35^\circ</m> F.
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}35\amp =40+0.25N\\ -5 \amp = 0.25N\\ -20 \amp =N \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we see that <m>D(-20)=35</m>.
          In context, this means that when it's <m>35^\circ</m> outside,
          we should hear <m>-20</m> chirps per minute.
          A negative number of chirps per minute does not make sense,
          and so we can see that the model is not valid when the outside temperature is <m>35^\circ</m> F.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point in the modeling process,
          a scientist would need to revisit the physical situation and make further observations.
          Indeed, Dolbear observed that temperatures below
          <m>50^\circ</m> F are too cold for the crickets and temperatures above
          <m>85^\circ</m> F are too hot for the crickets,
          so the model is only accurate for temperatures between <m>50^\circ</m> F and
          <m>85^\circ</m> F. What is the fewest number of chirps per minute an observer could expect to hear?
          The greatest number of chirps per minute?
        </p>
        <p>
          From the original observations in <xref ref="tab_dolbear1" autoname="yes"/>, we can see that <m>D(40)=50</m>.
          Using the algebraic function, we can compute
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}85 \amp = 0.25N+40\\ 45 \amp = 0.25N\\ 180 \amp =N \end{aligned}
          </me>
          so that <m>D(180)=85</m>.
          Thus we can expect to observe between 40 and 180 chirps per minute for temperatures between <m>50^\circ</m> F and
          <m>85^\circ</m> F. Note that we are using our understanding of the shape of linear functions here:
          this is an increasing linear function,
          so the values of the outputs increase steadily with the values of the inputs.

    <remark>
      <p>
        When working with a model,
        it is common to have to restrict the domain of a function based on real-world conditions,
        rather than algebraic requirements,
        so that the model makes sense in the context it is meant to represent.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Here is another physical phenomenon where a linear function provides an appropriate model:
      measuring the area of a glacier over time.
      Remember: linear functions have constant average rates of change,
      so are ideal for modeling quantities that change at a constant rate.

    <title>Modeling with Quadratic Functions: Falling Objects</title>
    <p>
      One of the reasons that quadratic functions are so important is because of a physical fact of the universe we inhabit:
      for an object only being influenced by gravity,
      <em>acceleration due to gravity is constant</em>.
      If we measure time in seconds and a rising or falling object's height in feet,
      the gravitational constant is <m>-32</m> feet per second per second,
      where the negative sign signifies that gravity is pulling "down," meaning toward the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the fantastic consequences of calculus <mdash/> which,
      like the realization that acceleration due to gravity is constant,
      is largely due to Sir Isaac Newton in the late 1600s <mdash/> is that the height of a falling object at time <m>t</m> is modeled by a quadratic function.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_fallingobject">
      <title>Height of an object falling under the force of gravity</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For an object tossed vertically from an initial height of <m>s_0</m> feet with a velocity of <m>v_0</m> feet per second,
          the object's height at time <m>t</m>
          (in seconds)
          is given by the formula
          <me>
            h(t) = -16t^2+v_0t+s_0
          </me>
          and corresponds to a gravitational constant of <m>g=-32</m> ft/s<m>^2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If height is measured instead in meters and velocity in meters per second,
          the gravitational constant is <m>g=-9.8</m> m/s<m>^2</m> and the function <m>h</m> has form <m>h(t) = -4.9t^2+v_0t+s_0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We will see where this formula comes from later in the course!
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_APC1-5-4">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A water balloon is tossed vertically from a dorm room window at an initial height of 37 feet with an initial velocity of 41 feet per second.
          We can use Theorem <xref ref="thm_fallingobject" autoname="yes"/> to model the height of the water balloon.
          First, we notice that since the information is given in feet and seconds,
          we should use the formula
          <me>
            h(t) = -16t^2+v_0t+s_0
          </me>
          corresponding to a gravitational constant of <m>-32</m> ft/s<m>^2</m>.
          Next, we determine the constants in the formula.
          The initial height in the problem is given as 37 feet,
          so we have
          <me>
            s_0 = 37
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial velocity is given as 41 feet per second.
          Note the units!
          This is the rate of change of position.
          Thus we have
          <me>
            v_0 = 41
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus our model is
          <me>
            h(t) = -16t^2+41t+37
          </me>
          where <m>t</m> is measured in seconds,
          <m>t=0</m> denotes the time at which the water balloon is thrown,
          and <m>h(t)</m> is measured in feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have our model, let's answer some questions.
          First, let's determine the time that the water balloon hits the ground.
          At that time,
          the height will be 0, so our mathematical task is to solve
          <me>
            h(t) = -16t^2+41t+37 = 0
          </me>
          for <m>t</m>,
          noting that we would like to have a positive time since our model only becomes valid after <m>t=0</m>.
          That quadratic equation does not look like it will factor nicely,
          so we will immediately use the quadratic formula:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}t\amp = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\ \amp = \frac{-41\pm\sqrt{(41)^2-4(-16)(37)}}{2(-16)}\\ \amp = \frac{-41\pm\sqrt{4049}}{-32}\\ \amp \approx 3.2697, -0.7072 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we are looking for a time
          <em>after</em> the balloon is thrown,
          the answer we are looking for is
          <me>
            \text{ the balloon hits the ground } t\approx 3.27\text{ seconds after it is thrown. }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This implies a domain for our model since the balloon cannot pass through the ground:
          the model <m>h(t) = -16t^2+41t+37</m> gives the height of the water balloon <m>t</m> seconds after it is thrown until it hits the ground,
          so for <m>t\in[0,3.27]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, let's graph our function and use that to estimate the time the water balloon reaches its highest point,
          along with its height at that time.
          This will give us the range of our model, as well.
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_waterballoongraph">
          <caption>The function <m>h(t) = -16t^2+41t+37</m> that models the height of the water balloon for <m>t\in[0,3.27]</m>.</caption>
          <image width="56%" source="waterballoongraph.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          From the Desmos graph,
          we can see that the quadratic function reaches its maximum at approximately the point <m>(1.281, 63.266)</m>.
          (We can also check that our model has the correct vertical intercept and that our computation for when the balloon hits the ground is correct.)
          The range of our model is <m>h\in[0,63.266]</m>.
          Interpreting this information back into the context of the balloon,
          we can say that the balloon reaches its highest point approximately <m>1.281</m> second after it is thrown,
          and that its height is <m>63.266</m> feet at that time.

      <p>
        One of our main goals this semester will be to develop algebraic methods with which to answer this last question of when and where a maximum occurs.

    <title>Cost, Revenue, and Profit</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we look at some of the functions of interest to decision-makers in a firm or industry.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <title>The Cost Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <em>cost function</em>,
          <m>C(q)</m> gives the total cost of producing a quantity <m>q</m> of some good.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      What sort of function do you expect <m>C</m> to be?
      The more goods that are made,
      the higher the total cost, so <m>C</m> is an increasing function.
      Costs of production can be separated into two parts:
      the <em>fixed costs,</em> which are incurred even if nothing is produced,
      and the <em>variable costs,</em>
      which depend on how many units are produced.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's consider a company that makes radios.
          The factory and machinery needed to begin production are fixed costs,
          which are incurred even if no radios are made.
          The costs of labor and raw materials are variable costs since these quantities depend on how many radios are made.
          The fixed costs for this company are $24,000 and the variable costs are $7 per radio.
          Then
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\text{ Total costs for the company }  \amp = \text{ Fixed costs } +\text{ Variable costs } \\ \amp = 24,000 + 7\cdot\text{ Number of radios, } \end{aligned}
          </me>
          so, if <m>q</m> is the number of radios produced,
          <me>
            C(q) = 24,000+7q
          </me>.
          This is the equation of a line with slope 7 and vertical intercept of 24,000!
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The variable cost for one additional unit is called the <em>marginal cost</em>.
      For a linear cost function,
      the marginal cost is the rate of change,
      or slope, of the cost function.

      <title>The Revenue Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <em>revenue function</em>, <m>R(q)</m>,
          gives the total revenue received by a firm from selling a quantity,
          <m>q</m> of some good.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If the goods sell for a price of <m>p</m> per unit,
      and the quantity sold is <m>q</m>, then
      <me>
        \text{ Revenue }  = \text{ Price } \cdot\text{ Quantity, } \text{ so }  R=pq
      </me>.
      If the price does not depend on the quantity sold,
      so <m>p</m> is a constant,
      the graph of revenue as a function of <m>q</m> is a line through the origin,
      with slope equal to the price <m>p</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If radios sell for $15 each, then the manufacturer's revenue function is
          <me>
            R(q) = pq = 15q
          </me>

          Graph the cost function <m>C(q) = 24,000+7q</m> and the revenue function <m>R(q) = 15q</m> on the same axes.
          For what values of <m>q</m> does the company make money?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The company makes money whenever revenues are greater than costs,
          so we find the values of <m>q</m> for which the graph of <m>R(q)</m> lies above the graph of <m>C(q)</m>:

        </p>
        <p>
          We find the point at which the graph of <m>R(q)</m> and <m>C(q)</m> cross:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\text{ Revenue }  \amp = \text{ Cost } \\ 15q \amp = 24,000+7q\\ 8q \amp = 24,000\\ q \amp = 3000. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The company makes a profit if it produces and sells more than 3000 radios.
          The company loses money if it produces and sells fewer than 3000 radios.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      This difference between the revenue and cost is called <em>profit</em>,
      and many decisions are made based on this quantity,
      rather than cost or revenue alone:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <title>The Profit Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <em>profit function</em>,
          written as <m>\pi</m> to distinguish it from the price,
          <m>p</m>, is the difference
          <me>
            \text{ Profit }  = \text{ Revenue } -\text{ Cost }  \text{ so }  \pi=R-C
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>break-even</em> point for a company is the point where the profit is zero and revenue equals cost.

          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that the negative of the fixed cost is the vertical intercept and the break-even point is the horizontal intercept when we graph <m>\pi(q)</m> in <xref ref="fig_radioprofitgraph" autoname="yes"/>:

      Just as we used the term marginal cost to mean the rate of change,
      or slope, of a linear cost function,
      we use the terms <em>marginal revenue</em> and
      <em>marginal profit</em>
      to mean the rate of change, or slope,
      of linear revenue and profit functions, respectively.
      The term <em>marginal</em> is used because we are looking at how the cost, revenue,
      or profit change "at the margin," that is,
      by the addition of one more unit.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, for the radio manufacturer,
          the marginal cost is 7 dollars/item
          (the additional cost of producing one more item is $7),
          the marginal revenue is 15 dollars/item
          (the additional revenue from selling one more item is $15),
          and the marginal profit is 8 dollars/item
          (the additional profit from selling one more item is $8).

          How is the idea of a "marginal" cost, revenue,
