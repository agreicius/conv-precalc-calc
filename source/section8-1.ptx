    <title>Functions Defined by Circular Motion</title>

      Certain naturally occurring phenomena eventually repeat themselves,
      especially when the phenomenon is somehow connected to a circle.

    <example>
      <title>The Height of a Point on a Circle</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          suppose that you are taking a ride on a ferris wheel and we consider your height,
          <m>h</m>,
          above the ground and how your height changes in tandem with the distance,
          <m>d</m>,
          that you have traveled around the wheel.
        </p>

          and then click on "Animate Point" so see how this motion creates a curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is another animation of this relationship between height and distance traveled around a circle,
          where the point is allowed to travel more than once around the circle:

    <p>
      The natural phenomenon of a point moving around a circle leads to interesting relationships.
      It is apparent that each point on the circle corresponds to one and only one height,
      and thus we can view the height of a point as a function of the distance the point has traversed around the circle,
      say <m>h=f(d)</m>.
      This is one example of what is known as a
      <em>circular function</em>.
      Such functions arise from
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            taking any circle in the plane,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            choosing a starting location for a point on the circle,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            letting the point traverse the circle continuously,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            and tracking the height of the point as it traverses the circle.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Every circular function has several important features that are connected to the circle that defines the function.
      For the discussion that follows,
      we focus on circular functions that result from tracking the <m>y</m>-coordinate of a point moving counterclockwise around a circle of radius <m>a</m> centered at the point <m>(k,m)</m>.
      Further, we will denote the circumference of the circle by the lowercase letter <m>p</m>
      (for "period").
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_APCFigure2-1-9">
      <caption>A point traversing the circle.</caption>
      <image width="37%" source="APCFigure2-1-9.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We assume that the point traversing the circle starts at the point <m>P</m> in <xref ref="fig_APCFigure2-1-9">Figure</xref>.
      Its height is initially <m>y=m+a</m>,
      and then its height decreases to <m>y=m</m> as we traverse to <m>Q</m>.
      Continuing, the point's height falls to <m>y=m-a</m> at <m>R</m>,
      and then rises back to <m>y=m</m> at <m>S</m>,
      and eventually back up to <m>y=m+a</m> at the top of the circle.
      If we plot these heights continuously as a function of distance,
      <m>d</m>, traversed around the circle,
      we get the curve shown in <xref ref="fig_APCFigure2-1-10">Figure</xref>.
      This curve has several important features for which we introduce important terminology.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      The <em>midline</em> of a circular function is the horizontal line <m>y=m</m> for which half the curve lies above the line and half the curve lies below.
      If the circular function results from tracking the <m>y</m>-coordinate of a point traversing a circle,
      <m>y=m</m> corresponds to the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the center of the circle.
      In addition, the <em>amplitude</em>
      of a circular function is the maximum deviation of the curve from the midline.
      Note particularly that the value of the amplitude, <m>a</m>,
      corresponds to the radius of the circle that generates the curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we can traverse the circle in either direction and for as far as we wish,
      the domain of any circular function is the set of all real numbers.
      From our observations about the midline and amplitude,
      it follows that the range of a circular function with midline <m>y=m</m> and amplitude <m>a</m> is the interval <m>[m-a,m+a]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that in <xref ref="fig_APCFigure2-1-10">Figure</xref>,
      the heights repeat once the point has traveled once around the circle,
      meaning once the point has traveled a distance of <m>p</m> units.
      The amount of time <m>p</m> that it takes the circular function to begin repeating is called the <em>period</em>,
      and we introduce the formal definition of a
      <em>periodic function</em>.
      This means a function that repeats itself after a fixed-length interval.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a function whose domain is the set of real numbers.
          We say that <m>f</m> is <em>periodic</em>
          provided that there exists a real number <m>k</m> such that
          <m>f(x+k) = f(x)</m> for every possible choice of <m>x</m>.
          The smallest value <m>p</m> for which
          <m>f(x+p)=f(x)</m> for every choice of <m>x</m> is called the
          <em>period</em> of <m>f</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For a circular function,
      the period is always the circumference of the circle that generates the curve.
      In <xref ref="fig_APCFigure2-1-10">Figure</xref>,
      we see how the curve has completed one full cycle of behavior every <m>p</m> units,
      regardless of where we start on the curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Circular functions arise as models for important phenomena in the world around us,
      such as in a <em>harmonic oscillator</em>: Consider a mass attached to a spring where the mass sits on a frictionless surface.
      After setting the mass in motion by stretching or compressing the spring,
      the mass will oscillate indefinitely back and forth,
      and its distance from a fixed point on the surface turns out to be given by a circular function.
      This may seem irrelevant to your everyday life,
      but it is the model of motion that vibrating particles obey,
      as well as planets in the solar system:
      picture the gravitational pull of the sun on a planet as the "spring." The planets oscillate along in their orbits.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A weight is placed on a frictionless table next to a wall and attached to a spring that is fixed to the wall.
          From its natural position of rest,
          the weight is imparted an initial velocity that sets it in motion.
          The weight then oscillates back and forth,
          and we can measure its distance, <m>h = f(t)</m>
          (in inches)
          from the wall at any given time, <m>t</m>
          (in seconds).

        </figure>
        <p>
          The period of <m>f</m> is 4 units,
          since we can see from the graph in <xref ref="fig_APCActivity2-1-3">Figure</xref>
          that the values of <m>f</m> repeat themselves once we move 4 units to the right.
          The midline is <m>y=8</m> and the amplitude is <m>5</m> since the values of <m>f</m> oscillate back and forth between <m>3=8-5</m> and <m>13=8+5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interpreting this in the context of the weight,
          we see that it oscillates between 3 and 13 inches from the wall,
          repeating its motion every 4 seconds.
          At rest, the weight was 8 inches from the wall,
          and while it oscillates, the longest the spring stretches is 5 inches.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can use these patterns to predict the distance of the weight from the wall at a future time.
          For example,
          <m>f(6.75)</m> will be the same as <m>f(2.75) = 12.619</m>,
          since the function repeats every four units.
          Likewise, <m>f(11.25) = f(7.25)=f(3.25) = 12.619</m>.
          Thus the weight will be <m>12.619</m> inches from the wall after <m>2.75</m> seconds,
          <m>3.25</m> seconds,
          <m>6.75</m> seconds, <m>7.25</m> seconds,
          <m>11.25</m> seconds, etc.

    <title>The Unit Circle</title>
    <p>
      As demonstrated in the previous section,
      certain periodic phenomena are closely linked to circles and circular motion.
      Rather than regularly work with circles of different center and radius,
      it turns out to be ideal to work with one standard circle and build all circular functions from it.
      The <em>unit circle</em> is the circle of radius <m>1</m> that is centered at the origin,
      <m>(0,0)</m>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_APCFigure2-2-1">

    <p>
      If we pick any point <m>(x,y)</m> that lies on the unit circle,
      the point is associated with a right triangle whose horizontal leg has length <m>|x|</m> and whose vertical leg has length <m>|y|</m>,
      as seen in <xref ref="fig_APCFigure2-2-1">Figure</xref>.
      By the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that
      <me>
        x^2+y^2=1
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the equation of the unit circle:
      a point <m>(x,y)</m> lies on the unit circle if and only if <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To study the circular functions generated by the unit circle,
      we will also animate a point and let it move around the circle:

      Starting at <m>(1,0)</m> indicated by <m>t_0</m> in <xref ref="fig_APCFigure2-2-2">Figure</xref>,
      we see a sequence of points that result from traveling a distance along the circle that is <m>1/24</m> the circumference of the unit circle.
      Recall that the circumference of a circle of radius <m>r</m> is <m>C=2\pi r</m>,
      so the unit circle's circumference is <m>C=2\pi (1) = 2\pi</m>.
      It follows that the distance from <m>t_0</m> to <m>t_1</m> is
      <me>
        d = \frac{1}{24}\cdot 2\pi = \frac{\pi}{12}
      </me>.
      As we work to better understand the unit circle,
      we will commonly use fractional multiples of <m>\pi</m> as these result in natural distances traveled along the unit circle.
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="ex_APCPreview2-2-1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In the picture below,
          there are 24 equally spaced points on the unit circle.

          Thus, the first point counterclockwise from <m>(1,0)</m> corresponds to the distance

          The second point is twice as far,

      For reasons you will see later,
      mathematicians prefer to use radians to measure angles,
      rather than degrees.
      (This is for similar reasons to why mathematicians prefer the base of <m>e</m> in exponential functions and logarithms.
      It has to do with derivatives.)
      Radians are defined by intersecting a <em>central angle</em>,
      meaning an angle with vertex at the center of the circle,
      with the perimeter of the circle.

      <title>Radians</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An angle whose vertex is at the center of a circle measures <em>1 radian</em>
          provided that the arc the angle intercepts on the circle equals the radius of the circle as in <xref ref="fig_APCFigure2-2-4">Figure</xref>.

      Click on this link to see an illustration of the definition of a <em>radian</em>,
      found by taking the radius of the circle and measuring the same length around the perimeter:
    </p>
    <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_radians.gif">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_radians.gif</url>
    <p>
      As seen in <xref ref="fig_APCFigure2-2-4">Figure</xref>,
      on the unit circle this means that a central angle has measure <m>1</m> radian whenever it intercepts an arc of length <m>1</m> unit along the circumference.
      Because of this important correspondence between the unit circle and radian measure
      (one unit of arc length on the unit circle corresponds to <m>1</m> radian),
      we focus our discussion of radian measure within the unit circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there are <m>2\pi</m> units of length along the unit circle's circumference it follows there are
      <m>\frac{1}{4}\cdot2\pi = \frac{\pi}{2}</m> units of length in <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of a revolution.
      We also know that <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of a revolution corresponds to a central angle that is a right angle,
      whose familiar degree measure is
      <m>90^\circ</m> If we extend to a central angle that intercepts half the circle,
      we see similarly that <m>\pi</m> radians corresponds to <m>180^\circ</m>;
      this relationship enables us to convert angle measures from radians to degrees and vice versa.

    <title>The Sine and Cosine Functions</title>
    <p>
      The circular function that tracks the height of a point on the unit circle traversing counterclockwise from <m>(1,0)</m> as a function of the corresponding central angle
      (in radians)
      is one of the most important functions in mathematics.
      As such, we give the function a name:
      the <em>sine</em> function.
      Just as we can view the height (<m>y</m>-coordinate) as a function of the angle <m>\theta</m>,
      the <m>x</m>-coordinate is likewise a function of <m>\theta</m> and is called the
      <em>cosine</em> function.

      <title>Sine and Cosine Functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given any angle <m>\theta</m> measured in radians and in standard position,
          let <m>(x,y)</m> be the point where the terminal edge of <m>\theta</m> intersects the unit circle.
          The <em>sine</em> and <em>cosine functions</em>
          of an angle <m>\theta</m> are the coordinates <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> for <m>\theta</m>:

            \sin\theta = y \qquad \cos\theta = x

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          because an angle of 0 radians in standard position has terminal edge equal to the positive <m>x</m>-axis,
          it intercepts the unit circle at the point <m>(1,0)</m>:

        <p>
          Because of this,
          <me>
            \sin(0) = 0\qquad\text{ and } \qquad\cos(0) = 1
          </me>.

        <p>
          An angle of <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians in standard position has terminal edge equal to the
          <em>negative</em> <m>y</m>-axis,
          because negative angles are measured clockwise from the positive <m>x</m>-axis.
          So the terminal edge of the angle
          <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m> intercepts the unit circle at the point <m>(0,-1)</m>.

      Because the sine function results from tracking the <m>y</m>-coordinate of a point traversing the unit circle and the cosine function from the <m>x</m>-coordinate,
      the two functions have several shared properties of circular functions:

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    Circular function, midline, amplitude, period, periodic function; unit circle, central angle, radians, standard position, initial edge, terminal edge, positive angle, negative angle; the sine function, the cosine function, the tangent function.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The motion of a point around a circle defines circular functions,
      which have a predictable shape
      (with a midline, amplitude, and period).
      Mathematicians use radians instead of degrees to measure angles,
      based on the length around the perimeter of a circle of radius 1
      (called a unit circle).
      We use the unit circle to define two important circular functions:
      sine and cosine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em> If you <em>really</em>
      understand the definitions of sine and cosine,
      all of their properties and values can be determined by the unit circle.
      We will get MUCH more practice with this in the next section.
