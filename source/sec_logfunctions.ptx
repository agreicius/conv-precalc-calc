    <title>Defining Logarithmic Functions</title>
    <p>
      We saw at the end of the last section in <xref ref="thm_propertiesofexpfunctions">Theorem</xref>
      that every exponential function
      <m>f(x) = b^x</m> passes the Horizontal Line Test,
      and so every exponential function has an inverse.
      In this section,
      we will define and explore inverse functions to the exponential functions.
      These inverse functions have a specific name:
      <em>logarithmic functions</em>.

    <p>
      \fbox{As a special case,
      the inverse of the base-<m>10</m> exponential function <m>10^x</m> is often written without an explicit base:
      <me>
        \log_{10} x = \log x
      </me>,
      This is the power to which we raise <m>10</m> to get <m>x</m>:
      <me>
        y=\log_{10}x  \Leftrightarrow 10^y=x
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why single out the base-<m>10</m> logarithm as the meaning of <m>\log</m> without an explicit base?
      This convention varies by discipline and is most common in the sciences where people make frequent use of scientific notation,
      where very large numbers are written in terms of powers of 10, such as
      <me>
        5,000,000,000 = 5\times10^9
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In computer science,
      people are more likely to use base-<m>2</m> logarithms without an explicit base due to the use of powers of 2 for the size of data (a byte is <m>2^8</m>,
      a kilobyte is <m>2^{10}</m>, a megabyte is <m>2^{20}</m>, etc.).
      Mathematicians typically use a base of <m>e</m>,
      which you will learn about in a future section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that on WeBWorK, the function <m>\log</m> denotes <m>\log_e</m>,
      rather than either <m>\log_{10}</m> or <m>\log_{2}</m>.
      On WeBWorK, you will need to enter
      <m>\log_{10}(x)</m> as "log10<m>(x)</m>."
    </p>
    <p>
      We require that the base <m>b</m> satisfy <m>b>0</m> and <m>b\neq 1</m>,
      because these are exactly the conditions we must have for <m>y=b^x</m> to be an exponential function.

          Both functions are graphed below.
          Note that the graph of <m>f^{-1}(x) = \log_2 x</m> is the graph of
          <m>f(x) = 2^x</m> reflected over the line <m>y=x</m>.

          The domain of <m>f(x) = 2^x</m> is the set of all real numbers and its range is the set of all positive numbers:
          <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
          Inverse functions switch input and output,
          thus switch domain and range,
          hence we know that the domain of <m>f^{-1}(x) = \log_2 x</m> is
          <m>(0,\infty)</m> and its range is <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.
          We can confirm this graphically in <xref ref="fig_ExpLog2">Figure</xref>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Recall that inverse functions describe the same relationship as the original function from a different perspective.
      In this way,
      logarithms are simply a different perspective on exponential relationships.
      In other words,
      logarithms give us an equivalent way to write exponential equations.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For instance,
          <me>
            10^2 = 100\text{ and } \log_{10}(100) = 2
          </me>
          each say the same thing from two different perspectives.
          The first says "100 is 10 to the power 2", while the second says "2 is the power to which we raise 10 to get 100." Similarly
          <me>
            10^{-3} = \frac{1}{1000}\text{ and } \log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{1000}\right) = -3
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first says "10 to the power of <m>-3</m> is
          <m>\frac{1}{1000}</m>" while the second says "<m>-3</m> is the power to which we raise 10 to get <m>\frac{1}{1000}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Remember that we began by defining inverse functions as reverse processes of each other via the identities
      <me>
        f(f^{-1}(x))=x\qquad\text{ and } \qquad f(f^{-1}(x))=x
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is also true for exponential functions and logarithms.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If we rearrange the statements of the facts in
          <m>10^2 = 100</m> and <m>\log_{10}(100) = 2</m>,
          we can see yet another important relationship between the powers of 10 and base-10 logarithm function.
          Noting that <m>\log_{10}(100) = 2</m> and
          <m>100 = 10^2</m> are equivalent statements,
          and substituting the latter equation into the former, we see that
          <me>
            \log_{10}(10^2) = 2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In words, this equation says that "the power to which we raise <m>10</m> to get <m>10^2</m> is 2." That is,
          the base-<m>10</m> logarithm function reverses raising 10 to a power.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a similar way, if we rearrange the statements in
          <m>10^{-3} = \frac{1}{1000}</m> and <m>\log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{1000}\right) = -3</m>,
          we can observe that by replacing <m>-3</m> with <m>\log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{1000}\right)</m> we have
          <me>
            10^{\log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{1000}\right)} = \frac{1}{1000}
          </me>.
          In words, this equation says that "when <m>10</m> is raised to the power to which we raise <m>10</m> in order to get <m>\frac{1}{1000}</m>,
          we get <m>\frac{1}{1000}</m>."

          We can use the relationships between exponential functions and logarithms from above to solve equations involving both exponential and logarithmic functions:

                </me>
                because 21 is not a power of <m>5</m>.
                Now, we can convert the above expression into a logarithm using <xref ref="def_baseblogs">Definition</xref> and solve for <m>x</m>:

                we can begin by isolating the logarithm and then converting to an exponential form using <xref ref="def_baseblogs">Definition</xref>

                raising <m>3</m> to the power of each side,

    <title>The Shapes of Graphs of Logarithms</title>
    <p>
      As the inverse of exponential functions <m>f(x) = b^x</m>,
      we have already established that logarithmic functions
      <m>g(x) = \log_b x</m> have the set of all positive real numbers as their domains and the set of all real numbers as their range.
      In addition, being the inverse of <m>f(x) = b^x</m>,
      we know that when we plot exponential and logarithmic functions on the same coordinate axes,
      their graphs are reflections of one another across the line <m>y=x</m>,
      as seen below
    </p>
    <p>
      <image width="93%" source="TaalmanPage345.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider <m>b=2</m>.
      Because the graph of <m>f(x) = 2^x</m> increases more and more rapidly as <m>x</m> increases,
      the graph of <m>\log_2{x}</m> increases more slowly as <m>x</m> increases.
      Even though the logarithmic function grows very slowly,
      it grows without bound
      (meaning without reaching a horizontal limit)
      because we can make <m>\log_2 x</m> as large as we want by making <m>x</m> sufficiently large.
      For instance,
      if we want <m>x</m> such that <m>\log_2(x) = 100</m>,
      we choose <m>x=2^{100}</m>, since <m>\log_2(2^{100}) = 100</m>.
      If we want <m>\log_2(x)=1,000</m>,
      we can choose <m>x=2^{1,000}</m>.
      If we want <m>\log_2(x) = 1,000,000</m>,
      we can choose <m>x=2^{1,000,000}</m>, etc.

      <title>Simplifying Logarithmic Expressions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can use the logarithm rules to simplify expressions:
          <ol marker="labeltextbfalphitemsep10pttopsep5pt">
            <li>
              <p>
                We simplify <m>\log_64+2\log_63</m> without needing a calculator.
                First observe that we can use rule (c) to rewrite
                <me>
                  2\log_6 3 = \log_6 9
                </me>
                and then use rule (a) to combine terms,
                multiplying the arguments of both logarithms:
                <me>
                  \log_6 4+\log_6 9 = \log_6(4\cdot 9) = \log_6 36
                </me>.
                We know that <m>36 = 6^2</m> and so by <xref ref="thm_relationshipsoflogsandexp">Theorem</xref> part (e),
                <me>
                  \log_6 36 = \log_6 6^2 = 2
                </me>.
                In this way, we fully simplify
                <me>
                  \log_64+2\log_63=2
                </me>
                without needing to touch a calculator.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Similarly, we can simplify
                <m>\frac{1}{2}\log_5 16-2\log_5 10</m> without needing a calculator:
                <me>
                  \begin{aligned}\frac{1}{2}\log_5 16-2\log_5 10 \amp = \log_5 (16^{1/2})-\log_5 (10^2)\\ \amp = \log_5 4-\log_5 100\\ \amp = \log_5 \left(\frac{4}{100}\right)\\ \amp = \log_5\left(\frac{1}{25}\right)\\ \amp = \log_5(5^{-2})\\ \amp = -2 \end{aligned}
                </me>
                In order, we have applied Logarithm Rule (c), then Logarithm Rule (b),
                rewritten the fraction <m>1/25</m> in terms of a power of <m>5</m>,
                and then applied <xref ref="thm_relationshipsoflogsandexp">Theorem</xref> part (e).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

      </statement>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the equation below for <m>x</m> without using a calculator:

            2\log_{10}x = \log_{10}12+\log_{10}3
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Until you get used to applying all of these formulas,
          it is very important to keep track of which Logarithm Rule or part of <xref ref="thm_relationshipsoflogsandexp">Theorem</xref>
          you use at each step so that you do not misuse them.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      This last property of <xref ref="thm_logproperties">Theorem</xref> is extremely powerful:
      suppose that the exponent is a <em>variable</em>.
      By working with logarithms appropriately,
      it enables us to move from having a variable in an exponential expression to the variable being part of a linear expression.
      Moreover, it enables us to solve exponential equations exactly,
      regardless of the base involved.

          Hawksbill turtles are endangered and are extensively hunted as the traditional source of tortoiseshell.
          They currently have a population of 25,000 and the population is decreasing at a rate of 12% each year.
          How long will it be until there are under 5,000 hawksbill turtles left?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We measure the population of hawksbill turtles with the function
          <me>
            P(t) = 25000(0.88)^t
          </me>,
          using the growth rate of <m>-12\%</m> to determine the growth factor of <m>b=1-0.12 = 0.88</m>.
          We wish to solve the equation
          <me>
            25000(0.88)^t = 5000
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          First divide by 25000:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}0.88^t \amp = \frac{5000}{25000}\\ 0.88^t\amp =0.2. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We could convert this to a logarithm with base <m>0.88</m> in order to solve for <m>t</m>,
          or we could apply any other base logarithm
          (such as a base-10 logarithm)
          to both sides and use <xref ref="thm_logproperties">Theorem</xref>
          part (c) to bring the <m>t</m> out of the exponent:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\log_{10}(0.88^t) \amp = \log_{10}(0.2)\\ t\cdot\log_{10}(0.88) \amp = \log_{10}(0.2)\\ t \amp = \frac{\log_{10}(0.2)}{\log_{10}(0.88)} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefit to doing it this way is that most calculators have a <m>\log_{10}</m> key.
          Evaluating this, we get

            t = \frac{\log_{10}(0.2)}{\log_{10}(0.88)}\approx 12.59
          </me>.

      Here is one final useful property of logarithms:
      the <em>change of base formula:</em>
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Change of Base Formula for Logarithms</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any positive real numbers
          <m>d,
          a, b</m> such that neither <m>d</m> nor <m>b</m> are <m>1</m>, we have
          <me>
            \log_b a = \frac{\log_d a}{\log_d b}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This allows us to rewrite a logarithm in base <m>b</m> in terms of logarithms in any base <m>d</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The change of base formula is useful for simplifying certain gross computations involving logarithms.
          For example,
          <me>
            \log_{1/4} 32\sqrt{2}
          </me>
          is a bit eye-melting.
          However, notice that all of the numbers involved are powers of <m>2</m>.
          Thus we might think to use the change of base formula with <m>d=2</m>:
          <me>
            \log_{1/4} 32\sqrt{2} = \frac{\log_2 32\sqrt{2}}{\log_2(1/4)}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We now have two simpler, more manageable logarithms to deal with:
          <me>
            \log_2 32\sqrt{2}\qquad\text{ and } \qquad \log_2(1/4)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We could convert <m>32\sqrt{2}</m> into a power of 2, or we could first use Logarithm Rule (a) to make this calculation even simpler:
          <me>
            \log_2(32\sqrt{2}) = \log_2 32+\log_2\sqrt{2} = \log_2 2^5+\log_2 2^{1/2} = 5+\frac{1}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, we could either convert
          <m>1/4 = 2^{-2}</m> in order to see that <m>\log_2(1/4) = -2</m>,
          or we could use Logarithm Rule (b):
          <me>
            \log_2\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = \log_2 1-\log_2 4 = \log_2 2^0-\log_2 2^2 = 0-2 = -2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting all of this together, we see that:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\log_{1/4} 32\sqrt{2} \amp = \frac{\log_2 32\sqrt{2}}{\log_2(1/4)}\\ \amp = \frac{11/2}{-2}\\ \amp = -\frac{11}{4} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Which method is best?
          That depends entirely on which you think of first and can do most accurately.
          Just make sure not to make up your own "rules."
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can use the Change of Base Formula to see why we can solve <xref ref="ex_hawksbill">Example</xref>
          using any base logarithm and still arrive at the same answer.
          In particular,
          suppose we did use a base-<m>0.88</m> logarithm to solve the equation
          <me>
            0.88^t = 0.2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then have
          <me>
            t = \log_{0.88}(0.2)
          </me>.
          By the Change of Base Formula,
          we can rewrite this as a fraction using any base logarithm,
          including but not limited to base-10:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\log_{0.88}(0.2) \amp = \frac{\log_{10}(0.2)}{\log_{10}(0.88)}\\ \amp =\frac{\log_{2}(0.2)}{\log_{2}(0.88)}\\ \amp = \frac{\log_{b}(0.2)}{\log_{b}(0.88)} \end{aligned}
          </me>
          for any choice of <m>b</m> with <m>b>0</m> and <m>b\neq 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      <statement>
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier,
          evaluating logarithms on a calculator can be tricky,
          since most calculators do not have buttons that allow you to use an arbitrary base.
          For this reason,
          you may end up using the Change of Base formula more than any other logarithm rule or property.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the change of base formula to rewrite
          <me>
            \log_{7}(426)
          </me>
          in terms of base-10 logarithms.
          This is what you will need to do to enter such an expression into WeBWorK, using the function "log10<m>(\ldots)</m>."

    <title>Justifications for the Logarithm Rules</title>
    <p>
      Recall the Logarithm Rules from <xref ref="thm_logproperties">Theorem</xref>: For any positive real numbers <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> and any real number <m>n</m>,
      <ol marker="labeltextbfalphitemsep10pttopsep5pt">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\log_b(c\cdot d) = \log_b(c)+\log_b(d)</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\log_b\left(\dfrac{c}{d}\right) = \log_b(c)-\log_b(d)</m>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\log_b(c^n) = n\log_b(c)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also recall the Change of Base Formula for Logarithms: For any positive real numbers
      <m>d,
      a, b</m> such that neither <m>d</m> nor <m>b</m> are <m>1</m>, we have
      <me>
        \log_b a = \frac{\log_d a}{\log_d b}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier,
      you can memorize and use these without knowing why they are true.
      However, many people remember better with some kind of understanding of why a formula is valid.
      They are a result of the exponent rules.
      It is your choice whether you read the justifications and proofs below,
      and if you only have time to read one, I recommend the justification for part (c) of <xref ref="thm_logproperties">Theorem</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Justification of <xref ref="thm_logproperties">Theorem</xref> part (a):</em>
      Let's begin by working with a base of 10 instead of an arbitrary base <m>b</m>.
      Recall some of the rules for exponents in <xref ref="thm_rulesforexponents">Theorem</xref>.
      In particular, we know that
      <me>
        10^x\cdot 10^y = 10^{x+y}
      </me>.
      Applying <m>\log_{10}</m> to both sides, we have
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\log_{10}(10^x\cdot 10^y) \amp = \log_{10}(10^{x+y}) \\ \amp = x+y \end{aligned}
      </me>
      where the second equality is due to part (e) of <xref ref="thm_relationshipsoflogsandexp">Theorem</xref>.
      Part (e) of <xref ref="thm_relationshipsoflogsandexp">Theorem</xref>
      also tells us that <m>x = \log_{10}(10^x)</m> and <m>y = \log_{10}(10^y)</m>, so that
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\log_{10}(10^x\cdot 10^y) \amp = \log_{10}(10^{x+y}) \\ \amp = x+y\\ \amp =  \log_{10}(10^x)+\log_{10}(10^y) \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we have justified why,
      for any positive numbers <m>c=10^x</m> and <m>d = 10^y</m>,
      <me>
        \log_b(c\cdot d) = \log_b(c)+\log_b(d)
      </me>.
      This argument is valid because <m>c=10^x</m> and <m>d=10^y</m> can indeed be equal to any positive number for suitable values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
      and the range of <m>10^x</m> or <m>10^y</m> is all positive real numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Proof of <xref ref="thm_logproperties">Theorem</xref> part (b):</em>
      In order to call this a "proof" rather than a "justification," we will use the arbitrary base of <m>b</m> instead of an explicit base.
      Let <m>c=b^x</m> and <m>d=b^y</m>.
      Recall this means that
      <me>
        x=\log_b(c)\qquad\text{ and } \qquad y=\log_b(d)
      </me>.
      By nearly the same argument as in the justification for part (a),
      we can say that
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\log_b\left(\frac{c}{d}\right) \amp = \log_b\left(\frac{b^x}{b^y}\right)\\ \amp = \log_b(b^{x-y})\\ \amp = x-y\\ \amp =\log_b(c)-\log_b(d) \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Justification of <xref ref="thm_logproperties">Theorem</xref> part (c):</em>
      Because positive integer exponents are a shorthand way to express repeated multiplication,
      we can use the multiplication rule for logarithms to think about exponents as well.
      For example,
      <me>
        \log_b(a^3) = \log_b(a\cdot a\cdot a)
      </me>
      and by repeated applications of part (a) of the Logarithm Rules, we see
      <me>
        \log_b(a^3) = \log_b(a\cdot a\cdot a)= \log_b(a) + \log_b(a) + \log_b(a) = 3\log_b(a)
      </me>.
      A similar argument works to show that for every natural number <m>n</m>,
      <me>
        \log_b(a^n) = n\log_b(a)
      </me>.
      More sophisticated mathematics can be used to prove that this property holds for every real number exponent,
      not just for natural numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Proof of the Change of Base Formula:</em> Let <m>y = \log_b a</m>.
      Then <m>b^y = a</m>.
      Take <m>\log_d</m> of both sides to get
      <me>
        \log_d(b^y) = \log_d(a)
      </me>.
      By part (c) of <xref ref="thm_logproperties">Theorem</xref>,
      <me>
        y\log_db = \log_da
      </me>.
      Substituting for <m>y</m>,
      <me>
        \log_ba\cdot\log_d b = \log_d a
      </me>.
      Finally, dividing both sides by <m>\log_b a</m>,
      we have the change of base formula:
      <me>
        \log_b a = \frac{\log_d a}{\log_d b}
      </me>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms and formulas were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    logarithmic function; <m>y=\log_b x</m> if and only if <m>b^y=x</m>; <m>\log_b(b^x)=x</m> (for all <m>x</m>) and <m>b^{\log_b x} = x</m> (for all <em>positive</em> <m>x</m>); the Logarithm Rules and the Change of Base Formula.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The base-<m>b</m> logarithm
      <m>\log_b x</m> is the inverse of the base-<m>b</m> exponential function <m>b^x</m>.
      The domain of <m>\log_b x</m> is the set of all positive numbers and the range of
      <m>\log_b x</m> is the set of all real numbers.
      There are many rules and formulas associated with logarithms that allow us to solve equations involving exponential and logarithmic functions.
