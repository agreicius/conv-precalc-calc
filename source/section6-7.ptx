    <title>Computing Derivatives of Logarithmic Functions</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Since logarithms are defined as the inverse of exponential functions,
        we can use our knowledge of the derivatives of exponential functions to determine derivatives of logarithms,
        rather than having to start with the limit definition of the derivative.
        Here is how we can do this:
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>y=\log_b x</m> and <m>b^y=x</m> are inverses,
        we know that
        <me>
          b^{\log_bx}=x
        </me>.
        This is also part (f) of <xref ref="thm_relationshipsoflogsandexp">Theorem</xref>.
        We can take the derivative of both sides of this equation:
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx}\left(b^{\log_bx} \right)=\frac{d}{dx}( x)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The derivative of the right side is <m>1</m> since <m>\frac{d}{dx}(x) = 1</m>.
        On the left side, we know that the derivative of the composition
        <m>b^{g(x)}</m> will be <m>(\ln b) b^{g(x)} g'(x)</m>,
        by the chain rule.
        If we let <m>g(x) = \log_bx</m>,
        then <m>g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(\log_bx)</m> is precisely the derivative that we are trying to find:
        <me>
          (\ln b)b^{\log_b x}\cdot \frac{d}{dx}(\log_bx) = 1
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we can solve for <m>\frac{d}{dx}(\log_bx)</m>:
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx}(\log_bx) = \frac{1}{(\ln b)b^{\log_b x}}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are technically done,
        but because we know <m>b^{\log_b x} = x</m>,
        we can simplify further to:
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx}(\log_bx) = \frac{1}{(\ln b)x}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus we have discovered that the derivative of <m>\log_b x</m> is the fraction
        <m>\frac{1}{(\ln b)x}</m>: Notice that when <m>b=e</m>,
        <m>\log_bx=\log_ex = \ln x</m>, and <m>\ln(e)=1</m>.
        This means that
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx}\left(\ln x \right)=\frac{1}{x}
        </me>
      </p>
      <remark>
        <p>
          Up to this point,
          derivatives have been the same basic type as the original function from which they come.
          For example,
          derivatives of power functions are power functions,
          derivatives of polynomials are polynomials,
          and derivatives of exponential functions are exponential functions.
          Now something surprising happens:
          derivatives of logarithmic functions are not logarithmic!
          Even more surprisingly, logarithmic functions are transcendental,
          but their derivatives are algebraic.
        </p>
      </remark>

        Here are these derivative formulas summarized in a theorem:

      <title>A Detail About Domains and Absolute Value:</title>
      <p>
        Because <m>\ln x</m> has domain <m>(0,\infty)</m>,
        when we say that <m>\frac{d}{dx}(\ln x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>,
        we are also restricting <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> to the domain <m>(0,\infty)</m>;
        we cannot have a derivative where the original function is undefined!
        However, it would be a pity to let half of the derivative go to waste.
        Let's see how to use the entire domain
        <m>(-\infty,0)\cup (0,\infty)</m> of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the function <m>f(x) = \ln|x|</m>.
        We know from our previous study that
        <me>
          |x| = \begin{cases}x, \amp  \text{ when } x\geq 0\\ -x, \amp  \text{ when } x\lt 0 \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        In plain language,
        <m>|x|</m> "makes <m>x</m> positive", so for <m>x\lt 0</m>,
        <m>\ln|x|</m> is now defined.
        For example, when <m>x=-1</m>,
        we have that <m>|-1| = -(-1) = 1</m> and so now,
        <m>f(-1) =\ln|-1| = \ln(1) = 0</m> is indeed defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when <m>x=0</m>,
        <m>|0|=0</m> and so <m>f(0) = \ln |0| = \ln(0)</m> is still undefined.
        Thus the domain of <m>f(x) = \ln|x|</m> is <m>(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)</m> and we can write
        <me>
          f(x) = \ln|x| = \begin{cases}\ln(x), \amp  \text{ when } x> 0\\ \ln(-x), \amp  \text{ when } x\lt 0 \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now consider the derivative of <m>f(x) = \ln|x|</m>.
        When <m>x>0</m>,
        we can simplify <m>|x|=x</m> so that <m>f(x) = \ln|x|=\ln x</m> and so
        <me>
          f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(\ln x) = \frac{1}{x}
        </me>.
        On the other hand, when <m>x\lt 0</m>,
        we can simplify <m>f(x) =\ln( -x)</m>.
        Now the function <m>y = -x</m> is inside the logarithm,
        so using the chain rule, we have
        <me>
          f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(\ln(-x)) = \frac{1}{-x}\cdot \frac{d}{dx}(-x) = -\frac{1}{x}\cdot (-1) = \frac{1}{x}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that we got <m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> for both <m>x>0</m> and <m>x\lt 0</m>.
        Thus we have discovered that
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx}(\ln|x|) = \frac{1}{x}
        </me>.
        The benefit to this is that now both the original function and its derivative have the full domain <m>(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two graphs that follow illustrate that the associated slope function for <m>\ln|x|</m> is the function <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>.
        For negative values of <m>x</m>,
        as we move from left to right,
        the slopes of <m>\ln|x|</m> are negative with larger and larger magnitude while the heights of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> behave the same way.
        For positive values of <m>x</m>,
        as we move from left to right,
        the slopes of <m>\ln x</m> are positive but getting smaller while the heights of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> do the same.
      </p>

        <caption>The slopes of <m>f(x)=\ln|x|</m> are the heights of <m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>.</caption>
        <image width="93%" source="TaalmanPage366ab.png"/>
      </figure>

    <title>The Chain Rule with Logarithmic Functions</title>
    <p>
      By combining our new differentiation rules for logarithmic functions with the chain rule,
      we obtain the following rules for derivatives of logarithmic compositions:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}\left(\log_b(g(x))\right) \amp =\frac{1}{(\ln b)g(x)}\cdot g'(x)\\ \amp =\frac{g'(x)}{(\ln b)g(x)} \end{aligned}
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}\left(\ln g(x)\right )\amp =\frac{1}{g(x)}\cdot g'(x)\\ \amp =\frac{g'(x)}{g(x)}. \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the chain rule looks sufficiently different for logarithmic functions,
      we state it below with this new possible "outside" function of <m>\log_b x</m>:

    <theorem>

          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(\ln (x^2+1)\right)=\frac{1}{(x^2+1)}\cdot (2x)=\frac{2x}{x^2+1}

        <p>
          We could use log rules to rewrite <m>f(x)=\ln(kx)=\ln k+\ln x</m>,

          If we use the chain rule, we get the same result:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(\ln (kx)\right)=\frac{1}{kx}\cdot k=\frac{k}{kx}=\frac{1}{x}

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We begin by applying the quotient rule:

            f'(x)= \frac{\frac{d}{dx}(7e^{3x}-x^22^x)\cdot \log_5x-(7e^{3x}-x^22^x)\cdot \frac{d}{dx}(\log_5x)}{(\log_5x)^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's first calculate the necessary derivatives in the numerator separately.
          Begin with finding the derivative of <m>7e^{3x}-x^22^x</m>.
          In the first term, the derivative of
          <m>7e^{3x}-x^2 2^x</m> requires the chain rule:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}(7e^{3x}) = 7e^{3x}\cdot 3 = 21e^{3x}
          </me>
          and the derivative of the second term <m>x^2 2^x</m> requires the product rule:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 2^x) \amp = 2x2^x+x^2(\ln2)2^x\\ \amp = 2^x(2x+(\ln 2)x^2) \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, the derivative of <m>\log_5 x</m> from the far right of the numerator is:

        <p>
          Find the derivative of <m>f(x)=\ln\left(\left(\frac{x^2-1}{1-2x}\right)^2\right)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are a number of ways we could find <m>f'(x)</m>.
          One way is to jump right in and start differentiating.
          We would need two chain rules,
          followed by the quotient rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we can also use log rules to do a bit of algebra first,
          which will make our differentiation easier.
          First, bring the exponent of 2 down using part (c) of <xref ref="thm_logproperties">Theorem</xref>:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(\ln\left(\left(\frac{x^2-1}{1-2x}\right)^2\right)\right)= \frac{d}{dx}\left(2\ln\left(\frac{x^2-1}{1-2x}\right)\right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, use part (b) of <xref ref="thm_logproperties">Theorem</xref>
          to rewrite the fraction inside of the logarithm as subtraction outside of the logarithm:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(2\ln\left(\frac{x^2-1}{1-2x}\right)\right)= \frac{d}{dx}\left(2[\ln(x^2-1)-\ln(1-2x)]\right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we can calculate the derivative using only one chain rule for each term:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(2[\ln(x^2-1)-\ln(1-2x)]\right) = 2\left[\frac{2x}{x^2-1}-\frac{-2}{1-2x}\right]
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      This last example suggests a very useful method for finding derivatives of complicated functions:
      use the logarithm rules to break up a function algebraically in order to avoid using multiple derivative rules.

    <title>Logarithmic differentiation</title>
    <p>
      The calculation of derivatives of complicated functions involving products,
      quotients,
      or powers can often be simplified by taking logarithms.
      We saw a few examples of this in the last section.
      In this section, we will codify a new method of taking derivatives,
      called <em>logarithmic differentiation</em>,
      that takes advantage of the properties of logarithmic functions,
      and will also see how it can be used to take derivatives of yet another category of functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use logarithm rules to make taking derivatives easier,
      even if there are no logarithms involved in a problem.
      We cannot simply introduce a logarithm;
      that would change the function we are trying to differentiate.
      However, we can take the logarithm of
      <em>both sides of the equation</em>:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In order to take the derivative of
          <me>
            y = \frac{x^{3/4}\sqrt{x^2+1}}{(3x+2)^5}
          </me>
          we would need to first apply the quotient rule,
          then use the product rule for the derivative of the numerator,
          which involves using the chain rule for the derivative of <m>\sqrt{x^2+1}</m>.
          We would also need the chain rule for the derivative of the denominator.
          Instead, we take the natural logarithm of both sides and simplify using algebra:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\ln y \amp = \ln\left(\frac{x^{3/4}\sqrt{x^2+1}}{(3x+2)^5}\right)\\ \amp = \ln(x^{3/4}\sqrt{x^2+1})-\ln((3x+2)^5)\\ \amp  = \ln(x^{3/4})+\ln(\sqrt{x^2+1})-5\ln(3x+2)\\ \amp = \frac{3}{4} \ln x+\frac{1}{2}\ln (x^2+1) - 5\ln(3x+2) \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we move on to taking derivatives.
          Pay very close attention to the left-hand side of this equation!
          Since <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>,
          we must use the chain rule/implicit differentiation to take its derivative.
          However, the right-hand side of the equation is now much simpler to differentiate as there are no quotients or products.
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}(\ln y) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{3}{4} x+\frac{1}{2}\ln (x^2+1) - 5\ln(3x+2)\right)\\ \frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx} \amp = \frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{2x}{x^2+1}-5\cdot\frac{3}{3x+2} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can now solve for <m>dy/dx</m> by multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>y</m>:
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dx} = y\left(\frac{3}{4x}+\frac{x}{x^2+1}-\frac{15}{3x+2}\right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we started with an explicit expression for <m>y</m>,
          we would like to end with an explicit derivative <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>,
          meaning one that involves only the independent variable <m>x</m>.
          So we substitute <m>y</m> from the beginning of the problem:
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dx} =  \frac{x^{3/4}\sqrt{x^2+1}}{(3x+2)^5}\left(\frac{3}{4x}+\frac{x}{x^2+1}-\frac{15}{3x+2}\right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This expression is not pretty,
          but it gives us a formula for the derivative <m>y'=\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      \fbox{Here is a summary of the steps taken in this method,

      </ul>

    <remark>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x)\lt 0</m> for some values of <m>x</m>,
        then <m>\ln (f(x))</m> is not defined,
        but we can write <m>|y| = |f(x)|</m> and use the derivative rule
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx}\ln|x| =  \frac{1}{x}
        </me>.
        We can also distribute absolute values over products, quotients,
        and powers, so the computations are exactly the same:
        <me>
          |ab| = |a||b|,  \left|\frac{a}{b}\right| = \frac{|a|}{|b|}, |a^b| = |a|^b

          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, lets take the derivative of both sides:

    <p>
      None of the derivative rules we know apply to this function!
      The power rule <m>\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}</m> applies only to functions where the exponent is a number.
      The rule <m>\frac{d}{dx}(b^x) = (\ln b)b^x</m> applies only to functions where the base is a number.
      In general, we do not yet have a way to take derivatives of functions where the variable appears in both the base and the exponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logarithmic differentiation provides a method for taking derivatives of such functions.
      The key step in this method is to use the logarithm rule for moving the exponent in front of the logarithm,
      so that there is no longer an exponent with a variable:

        <p>
          First, let's take the natural log of both sides, and use algebra:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\ln(f(x)) \amp =\ln\left( x^x\right)\\ \amp =x\ln x. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, lets take the derivative of both sides:

            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}(\ln(f(x))) \amp =\frac{d}{dx}\left(x\ln x\right)\\ \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \amp  = x(1/x)+\ln x \end{aligned}
          </me>

          So, multiplying both sides by <m>f(x)</m>, we obtain:

          <me>
            \begin{aligned}f'(x)\amp  =f(x)( \sqrt{x}(1/x)+\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}\ln x)\\ \amp  =x^{\sqrt{x}}\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}+\frac{\ln x}{2\sqrt{x}}\right)\\ \amp =\frac{x^{\sqrt{x}}(2+\ln x)}{2\sqrt{x}}. \end{aligned}
          </me>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following methods were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    Logarithmic differentiation.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Derivatives of logarithms are algebraic functions:
      <m>\frac{d}{dx}(\ln x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx}(\log_b x) = \frac{1}{(\ln b)x}</m>.
      The chain rule looks strange when combined with logarithmic functions and is worth paying special attention to.
      Applying a logarithm to
      (both sides of)
      a function can allow us to break apart the function and avoid using complicated derivative rules.
      In order to take the derivative of a function with variables in both the base and the exponent,
      we <em>must</em> use logarithmic differentiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      We can use an absolute value within a logarithm to extend the domain of the function.
      In the case of <m>\ln|x|</m>,
      this does not change the derivative:
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}(\ln |x|) = \frac{1}{x}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      The logarithm rules are extremely useful.
