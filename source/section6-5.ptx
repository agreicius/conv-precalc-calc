    <title>Exponential and Logarithmic Functions are Continuous on their Domains</title>
    <p>
      Similar to the algebraic functions we worked with in the fall,
      exponential and logarithmic functions are continuous on their domains.
      Note in particular that their graphs do not have any jumps or holes on their domains.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Continuity of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          All exponential and logarithmic functions are continuous on their domains.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Remember that, practically speaking,
      if a function <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m> it means that we can evaluate the limit by evaluation <m>\ds\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)</m>,
      provided that <m>f(a)</m> is defined.

    <title>Limits at Infinity of Exponential Functions</title>
    <p>
      We have already established that any exponential function of the form
      <m>f(t) = ab^t</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive real numbers with <m>b\neq 1</m> is always concave up and is either always increasing or always decreasing.
      We next introduce precise language to describe the behavior of an exponential function's value as <m>t</m> gets bigger and bigger.
      To start, let's consider the two basic exponential functions <m>p(t) = 2^t</m> and
      <m>q(t) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t</m> and their respective values at <m>t=10, t=20</m>,
      and <m>t=30</m>, as displayed below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <image width="93%" source="APC3-2-1Tables.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the increasing function <m>p(t) = 2^t</m>,
      we see that the output of the function gets very large very quickly.
      In addition,
      there is no upper bound to how large the function can be.
      Indeed, we can make the value of <m>p(t)</m> as large as we'd like by taking <m>t</m> sufficiently big.
      We thus say that as <m>t</m> increases,
      <m>p(t)</m> <em>increases without bound</em> and write
      <me>
        \lim_{t\to\infty}2^t = \infty
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the decreasing function <m>q(t) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t</m>,
      we see that the output <m>q(t)</m> is always positive but getting closer and closer to 0.
      Indeed, because we can make <m>2^t</m> as large as we like,
      it follows that we can make its reciprocal
      <m>\frac{1}{2^t} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t</m> as small as we'd like.
      We thus say that as <m>t</m> increases,
      <m>q(t)</m> <em>approaches 0</em>.
      We write
      <me>
        \lim_{t\to\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t = 0
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've seen several times how the value of <m>b</m> affects the steepness of the graph of <m>f(t) = ab^t</m>,
      as well as how all graphs with <m>b>1</m> have the similar increasing behavior,
      and all graphs with <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m> have similar decreasing behavior.
      For instance, by taking <m>t</m> sufficiently large,
      we can make <m>(1.01)^t</m> as large as we want;
      it just takes much larger values of <m>t</m> to make
      <m>(1.01)^t</m> big in comparison to <m>2^t</m>.
      In the same way, we can make
      <m>(0.99)^t</m> as close to <m>0</m> as we wish by taking <m>t</m> sufficiently big,
      even though it takes longer for
      <m>(0.99)^t</m> to get close to <m>0</m> in comparison to <m>\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t</m>.
      For an arbitrary choice of <m>b</m>, we can say the following:
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_expatinfinity">
      <title>Limits at Infinity of $b^t$</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(t) = b^t</m> with <m>b>0</m> and <m>b\neq 1</m>.
          <ol marker="labeltextbfalphitemsep10pttopsep5pt">
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m>, then <m>\ds\lim_{t\to\infty}b^t = 0</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>b>1</m>, then <m>\ds\lim_{t\to\infty}b^t = \infty</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      In addition,
      we make a key observation about the use of exponents.
      For the function <m>q(t) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t</m>,
      there are three equivalent ways we may write the function:
      <me>
        \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t = \frac{1}{2^t} = 2^{-t}
      </me>.
      Now we can see that <m>q(t) = 2^{-t} = q(-t)</m>.
      Recall that the graph of a function <m>y=h(-t)</m> is the reflection of the graph of <m>y=h(t)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis.
      Therefore, we can say that the graphs of <m>p(t) = 2^t</m> and
      <m>q(t) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t = 2^{-t}</m> are reflections of one another in the <m>y</m>-axis since <m>p(-t) = 2^{-t} = q(t)</m>.
      We see this fact verified in the picture below:
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_APCFigure3-2-5">
      <caption>The graph of <m>q(t) = 2^{-t}</m> is the graph of <m>p(t) = 2^t</m> reflected across the <m>y</m>-axis, and vice versa.</caption>
      <image width="37%" source="APCFigure3-2-5.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Similar observations hold for the relationship between the graphs of <m>b^t</m> and
      <m>\frac{1}{b^t} = b^{-t}</m> for any <m>b\neq 1</m>.
      This allows us to analyze the limits at <m>-\infty</m> of functions <m>f(t) = b^t</m> quickly,
      using what we already know.
      For example, if <m>b>1</m>,
      we know that <m>0\lt \frac{1}{b}\lt 1</m> and hence
      <me>
        \lim_{t\to\infty}\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^t = \lim_{t\to\infty} b^{-t} = 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting this across the <m>y</m>-axis, we see then that
      <me>
        \lim_{t\to-\infty} b^t = 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar statement holds for <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m>,
      with the infinite limit of the exponential growth at infinity reflecting over the <m>y</m>-axis to the infinite limit of exponential decay at negative infinity
      (see the graphs in <xref ref="fig_APCFigure3-2-5">Figure</xref> to visualize this).
      Summarizing these observations:

    <theorem xml:id="thm_expatnegativeinfinity">

      <statement>

    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        It is very important and so we reiterate it again:
        values of <m>b^t</m> are always positive,
        even for negative values of the exponent <m>t</m>.

      and <xref ref="thm_expatnegativeinfinity"></xref>
      is in terms of base-2 exponential functions <m>f(t) = 2^{kt}</m>.
      If we insist that <m>k>0</m> is a
      <em>positive</em> number,
      then we have observed that <m>b^t = 2^{kt}</m> when <m>b>1</m>,

      The following example is intended to remind us how finite limits at <m>\infty</m> and <m>-\infty</m> can be interpreted visually as horizontal asymptotes:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>f(x)=\frac{3}{2+2^{-4x}}</m>.
          What are the horizontal asymptotes of <m>f(x)</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To find horizontal asymptotes,
          we must compute the limit of <m>f(x)</m> as
          <m>x\to \infty</m> as well as <m>x\to-\infty</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As <m>x\to \infty</m>, note that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to \infty} 2^{-4x} = 0
          </me>
          so that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{3}{2+2^{-4x}}=\frac{3}{2+0}=\frac{3}{2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          As <m>x\to- \infty</m>, note that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to -\infty} 2^{-4x} = \infty
          </me>
          so that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=\lim_{x\to-\infty}\frac{3}{2+2^{-4x}}=\frac{3}{2+\infty}=\frac{3}{\infty}=0
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The graph of <m>f(x)=\frac{3}{2+2^{-4x}}</m> therefore has
          <em>two different horizontal asymptotes</em> to the right and left.
          To the right there is an asymptote at <m>y=\frac{3}{2}</m>,
          and to the left there is an asymptote at <m>y=0</m>.
          We can check this by looking at the graph:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <caption><m>f(x)=\frac{3}{2+2^{-4x}}</m> has two different horizontal asymptotes to the right and left.</caption>
          <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage359.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Notice that the graph does indeed have a horizontal asymptotes to the right at
          <m>y=\frac{3}{2}</m> and to the left at <m>y=0</m>.

    <title>Limits of Logarithmic Functions</title>
    <p>
      We know that we can calculate limits of logarithmic functions at domain points simply by evaluation.
      What about non-domain points?
      Logarithmic functions have domain <m>(0,\infty)</m>,
      so we need to examine their limits as <m>x\to0^+</m> and as <m>x\to\infty</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider <m>b=2</m>.
      Because the graph of <m>f(x) = 2^x</m> increases more and more rapidly as <m>x</m> increases,
      the graph of <m>\log_2{x}</m> increases more slowly as <m>x</m> increases.
      Even though the logarithmic function grows very slowly,
      it grows without bound because we can make
      <m>\log_2 x</m> as large as we want by making <m>x</m> sufficiently large.
      For instance,
      if we want <m>x</m> such that <m>\log_2(x) = 100</m>,
      we choose <m>x=2^{100}</m>, since <m>\log_2(2^{100}) = 100</m>.

      Using this table, we can see that as <m>x\to\infty</m>,
      <m>\log_2(x)\to\infty</m>.
      Using limit notation, this means that
      <me>
        \displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}\log_2(x)=\infty
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, we saw that <m>\ds\lim_{x\to-\infty}2^x = 0</m>,
      meaning that when the input of
      <m>f(x) = 2^x</m> becomes large and negative,
      the output becomes closer and closer to 0.
      Recall that since <m>2^x</m> is always positive,
      the output is approaching 0 and is positive,
      which we can write as <m>\ds\lim_{x\to\infty} 2^x = 0^+</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using our understanding of inverse functions as swapping input and output,
      this tells us that as the inputs of
      <m>f^{-1}(x) = \log_2 x</m> approach 0 and are positive,
      the values of the output will become large and negative.
      Written as a limit:
      <me>
        \lim_{x\to 0^+}\log_2 x = -\infty
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In words, this tells us that we can make the values of
      <m>\log_2 x</m> as large and <em>negative</em>
      as we want by making <m>x</m> sufficiently small,
      meaning sufficiently close to 0.
      For instance,
      if we want <m>x</m> such that <m>\log_2(x) = -100</m>,
      we choose <m>x = 2^{-100}</m>,
      since <m>\log_2(2^{-100}) = -100</m>.
      If we want <m>x</m> such that <m>\log_2(x) = -1,000</m>,
      we choose <m>x=2^{-1000}</m>,
      since <m>\log_2(2^{-1000}) = -1000</m>.
      (Recall that <m>2^{-100} = \frac{1}{2^{100}}</m> is positive and very,
      very close to zero.
      <m>2^{-1000}</m> is even close to 0.)
      Thus as the inputs of <m>x</m> approach <m>0</m> and are positive,
      the values of <m>2^x</m> become infinitely large and negative,
      as illustrated in <xref ref="tab_zerolimitoflog2">Table</xref>:

      There is of course nothing special about the base <m>2</m>,
      and the above observations apply to logarithms of any base <m>b</m> with <m>b>1</m>.
      When <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m>, we have a different behavior,

      \fbox{ Something rather unexpected occurs for logarithms:
      they have vertical asymptotes!
      Previously, we have only encountered vertical asymptotes arising as the result of division by a quantity approaching zero.
      Add this fact to your collection of knowledge relating to vertical asymptotes:
      logarithmic functions have vertical asymptotes when their <em>arguments</em>,
      meaning the value the logarithm takes as input,
      approach 0 from the right. }
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>h(x) = \log_2(x^2-1)</m>.
          This can be viewed as a composition <m>f\circ g</m> where
          <m>f(x) = \log_2 x</m> and <m>g(x) = x^2-1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>argument</em> of the logarithm in
          <m>h(x) = \log_2(x^2-1)</m> is the expression <m>x^2-1</m>,
          and the values of this argument determine whether <m>h(x)</m> has a vertical asymptote
        </p>
        <p>
          We have established that <m>f(x) = \log_2x</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=0</m> for <m>x>0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>g(x) = x^2-1=0</m> for <m>x=\pm 1</m> and we can check via a sign chart that <m>x^2-1>0</m> for <m>x\lt -1</m> and for <m>x>1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the composite function
          <m>h(x) = f(g(x) = \log_2(x^2-1)</m> will have vertical asymptotes at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m>,
          but only on the sides where <m>x^2-1>0</m>,
          meaning from the left of <m>x=-1</m> and the right of <m>x=1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We see this illustrated in the graph below:
        </p>
        <figure>

          <image width="56%" source="LogVAs.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Note that the function <m>h(x) = \log_2(x^2-1)</m> has domain <m>(-\infty,-1)\cup(1,\infty)</m>,
          since this is where its argument <m>x^2-1</m> is positive,
          and that the vertical asymptotes occur at the edges of this domain.

    <title>Calculating limits involving exponential and logarithmic functions</title>
    <p>
      The ideas covered so far in this section allow you to calculate many limits that involve exponential and logarithmic functions.
      We can use algebraic methods and logical reasoning from last semester in order to determine the behavior of these limits.
      It's important to note that limits involving exponential and logarithmic functions can still be indeterminate,
      but many of the same methods and ideas can be applied with small modifications.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to0}\frac{3^{2x}+3^x-2}{3^x-1}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, we try to evaluate the limit.
          If we find that the limit is indeterminate,
          then we will use our limit-evaluating skills to rewrite the limit until it can be evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>
          As <m>x\to0</m>,
          both the numerator and the denominator approach zero,
          so this limit is of the form
          <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>, which is indeterminate.
          So, we need to rewrite the limit, likely using algebra.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that we can factor the numerator in the following way:
          call <m>z=3^x</m>.
          Then, <m>3^{2x}+3^x-2=(3^{x})^2+3^x-2=z^2+z-2</m>,
          which can be factored as <m>(z+2)(z-1)</m>.
          We then replace <m>z</m> with <m>3^x</m> to obtain a factored numerator:
          <m>3^{2x}+3^x-2=(3^x-1)(3^x+2)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Returning to the limit, we use the factored form of the numerator:
          <me>
            \displaystyle\lim_{x\to0}\frac{3^{2x}+3^x-2}{3^x-1}=\displaystyle\lim_{x\to0}\frac{(3^x-1)(3^x+2)}{3^x-1}
          </me>.
          How does this help us?
          Well, we now see that both the denominator and numerator have a factor of <m>3^x-1</m>.
          Using the cancelation property for limits,
          we can cancel these factors, and then finish the limit via evaluation:
          <me>
            \displaystyle\lim_{x\to0}\frac{(3^x-1)(3^x+2)}{3^x-1}=\displaystyle\lim_{x\to0}(3^x+2)=3^0+2=3
          </me>.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="thm_expatinfinity">Theorem</xref>,
          we know that as <m>x\to\infty</m>, <m>2^x</m>,
          <m>3^x</m>, and <m>4^x</m> all approach <m>\infty</m>.
          Therefore, the limit in question is an indeterminate form,
          with <m>\infty-\infty</m> in the numerator and another <m>\infty</m> in the denominator.
          An analog of the method of dividing by the highest power works in this case.
          Because <m>4^x</m> grows faster than either <m>3^x</m> or <m>2^x</m> as <m>x\to\infty</m>,
          <m>4^x</m> is the dominant term,
          hence we divide through by it:
          <me>
            \displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{3^{x}-2^x}{1+4^x}=\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{3^{x}-2^x}{1+4^x}\cdot \frac{(1/4)^x}{(1/4)^x}=\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{(3/4)^{x}-(2/4)^x}{(1/4)^x+1}=\frac{0-0}{0+1}=0/1=0
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that by dividing by the exponential function with the largest base,
          all of the bases are now between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>,
          so their limits approach 0.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          From <xref ref="thm_limlog">Theorem</xref>,
          we know that as <m>x\to0^+</m>,
          the quantity <m>\log_3x</m> in the denominator approaches <m>-\infty</m>.
          At the same time, the numerator <m>x^2</m> approaches <m>0</m>,
          therefore the limit in question is of the form <m>\frac{0}{-\infty}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This limit is <em>not indeterminate</em>;
          limits of this form are always equal to zero!
          As the numerator approaches zero,
          the quotient gets smaller.
          Similarly, as the magnitude of the denominator gets larger,
          the quotient gets smaller, Both the numerator and the denominator contribute to the quotient approaching 0.
          Therefore,
          <me>
            \displaystyle\lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{x^2}{\log_3x}=0

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This limit is of the indeterminate form <m>\infty-\infty</m>,
          since as <m>x\to\infty</m>,
          both <m>\log_2(x+1)</m> and
          <m>\log_2(x^2+1)</m> approach <m>\infty</m>.
          Luckily, using the algebraic rules of logarithms,
          we can rewrite the limit in an alternative form with a fraction,
          as follows:
          <me>
            \displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}[\log_2(x+1)-\log_2(x^2+1)]=\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}\log_2\left(\frac{x+1}{x^2+1}\right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          As <m>x\to\infty</m>, the rational function
          <m>\dfrac{x+1}{x^2+1}</m> approaches <m>0</m> and is positive,
          which in turn means that the quantity
          <m>\log_2\left(\frac{x+1}{x^2+1}\right)</m> approaches <m>-\infty</m>.
          Therefore,
          <me>
            \displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}[\log_2(x+1)-\log_2(x^2+1)]=-\infty

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    argument (of a logarithmic function)
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Exponential and logarithmic functions are continuous on their domains,
      and we can remember their limits at the edges of their domains via a few illustrative graphs.
      Expressions involving exponential functions can have different right and left horizontal asymptotes.
      Logarithmic functions have vertical asymptotes.
      The algebraic methods learned in the fall for evaluating indeterminate limit forms can be modified to calculate indeterminate limits of expressions involving exponential and logarithmic functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      Exponential functions <m>b^x</m> are defined for all real numbers and are always positive.
      Logarithms are undefined for non-positive values of their argument.
