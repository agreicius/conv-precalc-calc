    <title>Why Problem Solving?</title>
    <p>
      <em>Problem-solving</em> can mean many things.
      One way to describe it is as the ability to take an unfamiliar problem,
      make sense of the problem and come up with a way to solve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll work with both word problems and other problems.
      In particular,
      word problems are a training ground for the skill of
      <q>mathematizing</q>
      a situation that has words and numbers.
      We're not pretending these are necessarily realistic word problems but the point is for you to further develop your skills in more simplified situations and build your confidence.
      The hope is that this helps you become more comfortable looking at situations in a mathematical way,
      as you encounter more complicated ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we share a framework<fn>
      This framework is modified from that generated by George Polya,
      with credit also to Gizem Kaarali, Darly Cooper, Walter and Brown.
      </fn> to help you approach problems in an organized way.
      We'll explain it below and give examples of how you might use it.

      <em>Why a Framework? </em>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A framework provides a structure to support logical problem-solving and slows you down,
            which is a good thing at first.
            As opposed to worrying that you can't remember how to solve the problem immediately,
            you get used to brainstorming and taking time to make sense of the problem.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A framework provides a
            <q>common language</q>
            so students in different sections can better work with each other and with instructors and TAs from other sections.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Very Important!! We are NOT suggesting that there is always one way to approach a math problem.
      This framework is meant to support you to work on a problem in a systematic yet individual,
      creative way.
      In particular,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            In homework or class,
            we'll periodically ask you to try to use the framework.
            You will not be graded on precise use of the framework,
            but instead on the work shown and final results of your problem-solving.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We may model using the framework in class and in written solutions.
            Your work might look different or occur in different order than examples we provide.
            That is fine!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You may have a different approach to problem-solving that you like to use.
            That is fine!
            This is not meant to replace that,
            but rather to provide a(nother) pathway to problem-solving.

    <title>Problem-Solving Framework</title>
    <p>
      Here's the framework.
      Warning!
      It can be overwhelming to read all at once.
      Instead we recommend you try an example problem alongside.
      Keep track of the things you do,
      and then come back to the framework,
      and see how it might help with solving the problem.

        Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)</title>
        <p>
          Here are some possible things to do to help you understand the problem.
          You don't need to necessarily do all of them or to do them in a particular order.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Read it over once.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Visualize if possible:
                draw a diagram or picture, or sketch a rough graph.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Focus on what is being asked: What is the unknown information or the goal of the problem?
                What information is known?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Identify different quantities that might be relevant.
                Are they constant?
                Are they variables?
                Are they parameters?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Define notation and variables.
                Translate known and unknown information into notation and variables.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>2.
        Make a Plan</title>
        <p>
          In this step,
          the big point is to slow down and allow yourself to think versus trying to rely on a memorized approach.
          You brainstorm what could be relevant or useful to know or to do,
          and then make a plan to do it.
          You can actually carry out the plan in the next step.
          Here are some questions to help you.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                What connections or relationships are there between known and unknown quantities?
                Does one change with the other?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                What math tools, concepts, or formulas might be relevant?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Would making a table, function formula or graph be useful?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Is this like any familiar problem?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        Then
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Read over the problem again and decide which of the tools,
              relationships,
              are actually relevant and useful and make a step-by-step plan to use them.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <em>Note:</em> Your plan might not be the same as another person's.
        There are many pathways to solve a problem!
        Also, you may have done some work in "Meet the Problem" that helps you make a plan.
        These two steps are very connected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>3.
        Carry out Your Plan</title>
        <p>
          In this step,
          you actually do the work of the plan, computing a value,
          graphing, solving an equation or whatever you planned.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Along the way, look back at what you planned.
                Are you on track?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Do you need to modify your plan?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>4.
        Reflect Back (Looking Back)</title>
        <p>
          In this step, we look back to see if we've solved the problem,
          check our work and think about what we've learned.
          Here are some questions to help you.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Have you answered the question(s)?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Can you check your answer?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Did you include units, if necessary?
                Do a unit check: do the units make sense?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Can you interpret the answer?
                Does it make sense?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Was all of the information relevant or needed?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Does the answer fit your intuition?
                What surprised you, if anything?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>5.
        Critique and Change the Problem</title>
        <p>
          This is an optional step,
          but it is a great way to exercise your critical thinking,
          get curious and creative,
          and think about how the problem might connect to more real-world situations.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Were assumptions made in the problem?
                What were they?
                Are they reasonable?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                "Word Problems" in math classes are notoriously artificial.
                In what ways is the problem NOT realistic or practical?
                How could you change it to better reflect reality?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                How would you change the problem to make it more interesting?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                What other questions are you curious about after solving this problem?
              </p>

    <title>Some Myths of Problem-Solving</title>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <title>Myth: If you can't solve a problem in 5 minutes,
        this means you can't do it</title>
        <p>
          Definitely not!
          It might mean re-reading the problem to see it with new eyes,
          taking a break, or talking to a friend,
          classmate, or instructor about what you are thinking
          (but not asking them how to do it).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Myth: There is only one way to solve a problem</title>
        <p>
          There are many ways to solve most every problem.
          We are sharing a framework, not a formula.
          Your work using this framework may look different than your peers or instructor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Myth: Problems only have one right answer.</title>
        <p>
          While this will be true of most of the problems we do in this course,
          in many situations,
          there are a range of answers depending on the assumptions and parameters of the problems.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <title>Examples of Worked Problems</title>
    <p>
      This section contains a few examples to help you understand the framework.
      Try the problems first using the framework,
      then see the examples here.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll notice that there is NOT one way to use the framework.
      You might have written more or less than here.
      The author here included some side thoughts, too, in parentheses.
      As you solve problems,
      you should feel free to add your personality and make it your own!

      <p>
        Here is a worked solution to Example <xref ref="ex_frameworkexample1" autoname="yes"/>.

            <li>
              <p>
                We know the dimensions of the pool.

                It looks like this:

            <li>

                We know the rate of water into the pool is 100 liters per minute.

            <li>
              <p>
                Total Amount is rate <m>\cdot</m> time.

            Make a Plan <em>Here's one sample plan.</em>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Find the volume.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Divide by the filling rate to find the time:
                  <m>V = r \cdot t</m>, so <m>t = V/r</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The dimensions of the pool are in meters but the rate is in liters per minute.
                  So we'll have to find a conversion before dividing or change units afterwards.
                  We can use that 1 m<m>^3</m> <m>=</m> 1,000 liters.<fn>
                  A quick Google search will tell you this.
                  </fn>  We have a choice:
                  cubic meters to liters or from liters to cubic meters?
                  Let's do the first one<fn>
                  An alternate plan: Convert the rate 100 L/min to a rate with units cubic meters per minute.
                  You get a rate of 0.1 cubic meters per minute.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Now we need to convert.
                  We want to convert cubic meters to liters.
                  Since 1 cubic meter is 1000 L, the total volume in liters is
                  <m>600 \cdot 1000 = 600,000</m> L. (More than I expected!)

              <li>
                <p>
                  Divide by the filling rate to find the time.
                  Since <m>V = r \cdot t</m>, we have <m>t = V/r</m>, so
                  <me>
                    r = V/r = 600,000/100 =  6000 \text{ minutes }

                  Did we answer the problem?
                  It said "how long"? So 6,000 minutes.
                  This is hard to think about, so how many days would this take?
                  There are <m>24\cdot 60 = 1440</m> minutes in a day, so this is about 4 days.

                  This seems too long.
                  Did we make an error?
                  Did we forget a zero?
                  After checking, we see we did not.

              <li>
                <p>
                  We always want to check units.
                  Here's where we might catch ourselves if we forgot to convert,
                  since we'd get units of cubic meters per (liters/minute) which is not just minutes.

          The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,000 kilometers,
          and someone has just made a metal band that circles the Earth,
          touching the ground at all locations.
          You come along at night, as a practical joke,
          and add 10 m to its length.
          The band is now sits magically just above the ground at all locations creating a gap.

                  From the picture,
                  we see the space we want is the difference in the radius of the bands.

            <em>An alternate plan: There are other ways to approach this.
            For example, we can name the gap <m>\Delta r</m>,
            since it's the change in radius.
            Then <m>r_{new} = r + \Delta r</m>,
            and <m>C_{new} = 2\pi(r + \Delta r) = 2\pi r + 2\pi \Delta r = C + 2\pi \Delta r</m>.
            The difference in circumference is 10 m and it's
            <m>2\pi \Delta r</m> so we can solve for that gap.</em>

                    The original band is 40,000 km in circumference,

                    The change in radius only depends on the change in circumference,

                    We need to know how much distance each train covers over time,

              since it travels 55 mph and leaves at noon
              (<m>t =0</m>).
              <m>A(t) = 70(t-1)</m> since it goes 70 mph but only has traveled since 1 pm,
              so for example at <m>t = 2</m> its only traveled 1 hour thus only <m>70 \cdot 1</m> miles.
              Solve <m>55t = 70(t-1)</m> to get <m>t = 70/15 = 4.\overline{6}</m> hours.
              This means the trains would meet after <m>4.\overline{6}</m> hours.
              But the trip for the Regular train only takes <m>216/55 \approx 3.93</m> hours,
              so the Regular train will already have arrived in Boston.
              They don't meet!

          In 2020, a forest of 5 million trees was invaded by insects. 40% of the forests' original trees were susceptible to the insects,
          and of these, two-thirds die off.
          After that, each year,
          two-thirds of the remaining susceptible trees die off.
          Assuming no new trees grow in the forest and no other trees are harmed,
          how many trees are in the forest at the start of 2030?
          What happens to the forest in the far future?

              Notice this is an exponential decay situation.
              We are keeping <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>(<m>\approx</m> 33%) of the remaining susceptible trees each year,
              meaning <m>\frac{1}{3}^t (0.4)(5)</m> trees.
              We can add this to the other non-suspectible trees which remain constant,
              <m>0.6(5)</m> to get the formula for total trees:
              <me>
                T(t) = (0.6)(5) + (\frac{1}{3})^t (0.4)(5)
              </me>.
              Now <m>T(10) = (0.6)(5) + (\frac{1}{3})^{10} (0.4)(5) \approx 3.00003</m> million trees.
              We can also calculate <m>T(100) = (0.6)(5) + (\frac{1}{3})^{100} (0.4)(5)=3</m> million trees and that
              <m>T(1000) = (0.6)(5) + (\frac{1}{3})^{1000} (0.4)(5) = 3</m> million trees as well
              (according to a calculator),
              so there appear to be 3 million trees remaining after a long time.

              Reflect Back (Looking Back) We answered the question.
              There are about 3.00003 million trees at the start of 2030.
              As a basic check,
              we see this is less than the original 5 million which makes sense since trees have died off and there were no new trees.
              As time goes on,
              fewer and fewer of the susceptible trees will be left.
              Eventually, the population remaining will be only the non-susceptible trees,
              so <m>(0.6)(5) = 3</m> million trees, as calculated.
              Can you check your answer?
              We could check that our formula for <m>T(t)</m> matches what we put in the table.
              For example,
              that <m>T(0) = 5</m> and <m>T(1) = (0.6)(5) + \frac{1}{3}(0.4)(5)</m>,
              and so on.
