    <title>Trigonometric Relationships</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we look at a particular type of related rates problem that requires trigonometric functions.
      Recall from <xref ref="sec_relatedrates">Section</xref>
      that two quantities are related if there is an equation containing the two quantities.
      If those quantities change over time,
      then their rates of change are also related.
      We can find the relationship between the rates of change by taking the derivative of the equation involving the two quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legs <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and hypotenuse <m>c</m> of a right triangle are all related to each other via the different trigonometric functions.
      Moreover, both of the angles <m>\theta_1</m> and
      <m>\theta_2</m> opposite the legs are also related to the various sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <image width="28%" source="TrigRRTriangle.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      the hypotenuse <m>c</m> is related to both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> via
      <me>
        \sin\theta_1 = \frac{a}{c}\qquad\text{ and } \qquad \sin\theta_2 = \frac{b}{c}
      </me>.
      We could alternately use the cosine function instead to relate <m>c</m> to <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> via
      <me>
        \cos\theta_1 = \frac{b}{c}\qquad\text{ and } \qquad \cos\theta_2 = \frac{a}{c}
      </me>.
      Each of the legs of the triangle are also related to each other via
      <me>
        \tan\theta_1 = \frac{a}{b}\qquad\text{ or } \qquad\tan\theta_2 = \frac{b}{a}
      </me>.
      The two angles <m>\theta_1</m> and
      <m>\theta_2</m> are also related to each other.
      We already observed that <m>\sin\theta_2 = \frac{b}{c}</m> and that <m>\cos\theta_1 = \frac{b}{c}</m>.
      Thus we must have
      <me>
        \sin\theta_2 = \cos\theta_1
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, whenever we are solving a related rates problem that involves an angle and a triangle,
      we want to pick one of the equations listed above as our "relationship." Should you memorize these?
      <em>Absolutely not!</em> You should use the problem solving framework from Chapter 0 to help you <em>think</em>
      of what equation is most appropriate.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_TrigRRExample1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          suppose that the height <m>a</m> of a right triangle is increasing but that the base <m>b</m> stays the same length.
          As the height increases,
          the length of the hypotenuse <m>c</m> must also be increasing.
          Moreover, both of the angles <m>\theta_1</m> and
          <m>\theta_2</m> opposite the base and height must be changing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose we measure that the base <m>b</m> is 4 units and the height <m>a</m> is increasing by 2 units per second at the moment when <m>a=3</m>.
          Let's find the rate of change of <m>\theta_1</m>,
          the angle opposite <m>a</m>, at this moment.
          In other words,
          we are are given <m>b=4</m> and wish to find <m>\frac{d\theta_1}{dt}</m> when <m>a=3</m>,
          and <m>\frac{da}{dt} =  2</m>.
          First, let's note that we have information about <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
          and wish to know something about <m>\theta_1</m>,
          so out of all of the different relationships listed above,
          the most convenient one will be
          <me>
            \tan\theta_1 = \frac{a}{b}
          </me>.
          Now, since we wish to find <m>\frac{d\theta_1}{dt}</m>,
          it will be additionally convenient to solve for it using the arctangent function:
          <me>
            \theta_1 = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)
          </me>.
          We also remember that <m>b=4</m> is a constant, not a changing quantity,
          so we can substitute it in before taking the derivative:<fn>
          Alternately,
          we can work with the variable <m>b</m> and remember that
          <m>\frac{db}{dt}=0</m> when taking the derivative,
          but that will involve using the quotient rule when taking the derivative of <m>\frac{a}{b}</m>.
          </fn>
          <me>
            \theta_1 = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{4}\right)
          </me>.
          Taking the derivative <m>\frac{d}{dt}</m> of both sides,
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d\theta_1}{dt} \amp = \frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{a}{4}\right)^2}\cdot\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{a}{4}\right)\\ \amp =\frac{1}{1+\frac{a^2}{16}}\cdot\frac{1}{4}\frac{da}{dt}\\ \amp =\frac{\frac{da}{dt}}{4+\frac{a^2}{4}} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we remember that we want to find
          <m>\frac{d\theta_1}{dt}</m> when <m>a=3</m> and <m>\frac{da}{dt} = 2</m> and so we compute:
          <me>
            \frac{d\theta_1}{dt}\Big|_{\substack{a=3\\ \frac{da}{dt}=2} } = \frac{2}{4+\frac{3^2}{4}} = \frac{2}{25/4} = \frac{8}{25}=0.32
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence <m>\theta_1</m> is increasing at a rate of <m>0.32</m> radians per second.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        It's very important to note that whenever we are taking derivatives of trigonometric or inverse trigonometric functions,
        we must be measuring angles in radians.
        Otherwise the derivatives are incorrect.

      Let's look at some word problems involving changing lengths of triangle sides and angles.
      Note that all such problems will involve a triangle.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_rocket">
      <title>Watching a Rocket</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A SpaceX scientist uses a telescope to track a rocket launched vertically from a launching pad 6km away.
          At a certain moment,
          the angle <m>\theta</m> between the telescope and the ground is equal to
          <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m> and is changing at a rate of <m>0.9</m> radians per minute.
          What is the rocket's velocity at that moment?
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="37%" source="TrigRRRocket.png"/>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          As in the picture above, call the vertical height of the rocket <m>y</m>.
          The problem tells us to find <m>\frac{dy}{dt}</m> when
          <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}</m> and <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt} = 0.9</m>,
          given that the base of the triangle is <m>6</m>.
          Note that we have no information at all about the hypotenuse,
          so do not wish to use either the sine or cosine function.
          Thus we relate <m>y</m> and <m>\theta</m> with the tangent function:
          <me>
            \tan\theta = \frac{y}{6}
          </me>.
          Solving for <m>y</m>, we have
          <me>
            y = 6\tan\theta
          </me>
          and taking the derivative in order to relate
          <m>\frac{dy}{dt}</m> to <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt}</m>, we get
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dt} = 6\sec^2\theta\frac{d\theta}{dt}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          When <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}</m>,
          <m>\cos\theta = \cos(\pi/3) = 1/2</m> and so <m>\sec(\pi/3) = 2</m>.
          Plugging this in along with <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt} = 0.9</m>, we have
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dt}\Big|_{\substack{\theta = \pi/3\\ \frac{d\theta}{dt} = 0.9} } = 6\sec^2(\pi/3)\cdot(0.9) = 6(2)^2(0.9) = 21.6
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the rocket's velocity is 21.6 km/min.

          In <xref ref="ex_rocket">Example</xref>,
          could we have plugged in <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}</m> earlier so that <m>y = 6\tan(\pi/3)</m>,
          and then taken the derivative?

    <example xml:id="ex_flyingplane">
      <title>Tracking a Plane</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A plane flies horizontally at an altitude of 5 km and passes directly over a tracking beacon on the ground.
          When the angle between the beacon's line of sight to the plane and the ground is <m>\pi/3</m>,
          this angle is decreasing at a rate of <m>\pi/6</m> rad/min.
          How fast is the plane traveling at that time?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, we draw a picture of the scenario and label it with variable names and given information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="37%" source="TrigRRAirplane1.png"/> The problem asks us to find <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m> when
          <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}</m> and <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt} = -\frac{\pi}{6}</m>,
          given that the height of the triangle is 5.
          Again, we have no information about the hypotenuse so we would like to relate the two legs of the triangle directly.
          In order to see how to do this,
          notice that there is another triangle in the picture that also has height of 5 and that the plane's distance along the ground is the same as its distance in the air:
          <image width="37%" source="TrigRRAirplane2.png"/> Thus we see that
          <me>
            \tan\theta = \frac{5}{x}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Solving for <m>x</m>,
          <me>
            x = \frac{5}{\tan\theta} = 5\cot\theta
          </me>
          and so taking the derivative to relate
          <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m> to <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt}</m>,
          <me>
            \frac{dx}{dt} = -5\csc^2\theta\frac{d\theta}{dt}
          </me>.
          Finally we plug in the given quantities:
          <me>
            \frac{dx}{dt}\Big|_{\substack{\theta=\pi/3\\ \frac{d\theta}{dt}=-\frac{\pi}{6}} } = -5\csc^2(\pi/3)\cdot\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to simplify <m>\csc(\pi/3)</m>,
          we first remember that <m>\sin(\pi/3) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m> and so <m>\csc(\pi/3) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}</m>,
          hence <m>(\csc(\pi/3))^2 = \frac{4}{3}</m>.
          Then
          <me>
            \frac{dx}{dt}\Big|_{\substack{\theta=\pi/3\\ \frac{d\theta}{dt}} } = -5\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{10}{9}\pi\approx 3.49
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence the plane is flying at a velocity of about <m>3.49</m> km/min.

      </solution>

          Suppose in <xref ref="ex_flyingplane">Example</xref>
          that <m>\frac{dx}{dt}=3.49</m> km/min and the plane is still flying at a height of 5km.
          Find the rate of change of <m>\theta</m> two minutes after the plane flew over the beacon.
          Do you expect <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt}</m> to be positive or negative?

      <title>A Beacon of Light</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A lighthouse is located 3 kilometers away from a long,
          straight beach wall.
          The beacon of light is rotating steadily at a rate of 1.5 revolutions per minute.
          A lone soul is sitting on the beach wall 5 km from the lighthouse,
          staring into the sea and contemplating the universe.
          At what rate is the ray of light moving along the beach wall when it passes the thinker?
          <em>Caution: watch your units!</em>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This problem is particularly hard to picture,
          so take a moment to draw your own diagram before reading any further.
          Note that we do not know whether the light is rotating clockwise or counterclockwise,
          so we do not know whether the light is moving right or left along the wall.
          Our calculations below will thus be direction-less.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we picture the wall on the horizontal as below:
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="28%" source="TrigRRLight1.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          then we are asked to find <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m>.
          We are given that the light is rotating at a rate of 1.5 revolutions per minute.
          Translating this into radians,
          in one minute it circles around 1.5 times,
          meaning <m>3\pi</m> radians.
          Thus <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt} = 3\pi</m> rad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next notice that the angle <m>\theta</m> belongs to the triangle with hypotenuse <m>h</m> equal to the beam of light.
          Although the person is a constant 5km away from the lighthouse,
          the length of <m>h</m> varies as the light rotates and there is only a single moment when <m>h=5</m>.
          We are not given <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m>,
          however, so we do not want to use <m>h</m> in our relationship.
          Instead, we can use the distance between the lighthouse and the beach wall as the third side of our triangle.
          We know everything about it:
          its length is 3 and is constant so its rate of change is 0;
          it does not require a variable name.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can phrase our problem as: Find
          <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m> when <m>h=5</m> given that <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt} = 3\pi</m>.
          To solve our problem,
          we will use the relationship <m>\tan\theta = \frac{x}{3}</m> to write
          <me>
            x = 3\tan\theta
          </me>.
          Taking derivatives,
          <me>
            \frac{dx}{dt} = 3\sec^2\theta\frac{d\theta}{dt}
          </me>.
          Again, note that if we had involved the variable <m>h</m> in our relationship,
          we would have <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> in our derivative.
          As it is, we have to be able to compute
          <m>\sec\theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}</m> at the given moment when <m>h=5</m>.
          However, this is managed by drawing a second diagram,
          this time at the precise moment when <m>h=5</m>:
          <image width="28%" source="TrigRRLight2.png"/> We do not even have to solve for <m>x</m>:
          <m>\cos\theta = \frac{\text{ adj } }{\text{ hyp } } = \frac{3}{5}</m>.
          Hence <m>\sec\theta = \frac{5}{3}</m> and
          <me>
            \frac{dx}{dt}\Big|_{\substack{h=5\\ {\frac{d\theta}{dt} = 3\pi}} } = 3\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2(3\pi) = 25\pi\approx 78.54
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the light is moving at a rate of about 78.54 km/min along the wall.

          Hopefully this evokes memories of the beginnings of our exploration of trigonometric functions:
          the vertical movement of a point around the unit circle is described by the sine function.
          With this in mind,
          let's draw a circle of radius 10 representing our Ferris wheel and set our origin at the center of the circle.
          This means that "ground level" is at <m>y=-10</m>:
          <image width="37%" source="TrigRRFerrisWheel.png"/> We are told in the problem that <m>\theta</m> rotates once around every two minutes,
          so halfway around every minute,
          meaning <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \pi</m> rad/min. 16 m above ground level is when <m>y=6</m>,
          hence we are asked to find <m>\frac{dy}{dt}</m> when <m>y=6</m>,
          given that <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \pi</m>.
        </p>

          In this problem,
          we relate <m>y</m> and <m>\theta</m> using sine function and the constant hypotenuse:
          <me>
            \sin\theta = \frac{y}{10}
          </me>
          and solving for <m>y</m>,
          <me>
            y = 10\sin\theta
          </me>.
          Taking the derivative,
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dt} = 10\cos\theta\frac{d\theta}{dt}
          </me>.
          In order to find <m>\cos\theta</m> when <m>y=6</m>,
          we use the Pythagorean Theorem to find <m>x</m>.
          We have that <m>x^2+6^2 = 10^2</m> when <m>x = \sqrt{100-36} = \sqrt{64} = 8</m>.
          Hence <m>\cos\theta = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5}</m>.
          Now we can simplify
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dt}\Big|_{\substack{y=6\\ \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \pi} } = 10\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)(\pi) = 8\pi\approx 25.13
          </me>

          Assuming that the rider is on the way up,
          their seat is rising at a rate of about <m>25.13</m> meters per minute
          (equal to about 1.37 feet per second).

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The sides and angles of a right triangle are related via the trigonometric functions sine, cosine,
      and tangent.
      Use the trigonometric function that involves only quantities you wish to find and about which you are given information,
      then take the derivative to relate the derivatives of the quantities.
      Use the given information to determine the derivative you wish to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      Use constant values for quantities that do not change,
      but do not use given values of variables until
      <em>after</em> taking the derivative.
      Use units as "key words" in deciphering whether values given in the problem are for a quantity or its derivative.
      It's almost always necessary to draw a labeled picture
      (with variables and lengths)
      before realizing which equation to use.
