    <title>When is a Function Differentiable?</title>
    <p>
      We now know that the instantaneous rate of change of a function <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>,
      or equivalently the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>,
      is given by the value <m>f\,'(a)</m>.
      The process of "taking the derivative" generates a new function,
      <m>f\,'(x)</m>, derived from the original function <m>f(x)</m>.
      In this section,
      we look at the domain of the function <m>f\,'(x)</m> and what can cause it to be undefined.
      The key observation is that the derivative arises from a limit,
      and it is possible for a limit to fail to exist for several different reasons.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_parabolasaresmooth">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The derivative of the function <m>f(x) = 4x-x^2</m> is
          <me>
            f\,'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(4(x+h)-(x+h)^2)-(4x-x^2)}{h}
          </me>.
          The numerator simplifies as follows:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}(4(x+h)-(x+h)^2)-(4x-x^2) \amp = 4x+4h-a^2-2hx-h^2-4x+x^2\\ \amp = 4h-2hx-h^2 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then returning to the limit,
          we can factor an <m>h</m> in the numerator and cancel,
          before evaluating the limit:
          <me>
            \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{4h-2hx-h^2}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{h(4-2x-h)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0} (4-2x-h) = 4-2x-0 = 4-2x
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we have <m>f\,'(x) = 4-2x</m>.
          As a function,
          <m>f\,'(x)</m> is defined for all values of <m>x</m>.
          Below, we see the graph of <m>f(x)</m> on the left,
          with several tangent lines, and the graph of <m>f\,'(x)</m> on the right,
          with several values corresponding to the marked tangent lines.
          We see that where <m>f(x)</m> is increasing,
          <m>f\,'(x)</m> is positive.
          Where <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing,
          <m>f\,'(x)</m> is negative.
          We also notice that the graph of <m>f(x)</m> has a tangent line at every point,
          so the graph of <m>f\,'(x)</m> has a value at every point,
          meaning that it is defined for all <m>x</m>-values.
          Indeed, the function <m>f\,'(x) = 4-2x</m> is defined for all real numbers <m>x</m>.

    <remark>
      <p>
        Remember that when taking the derivative,
        it is always the variable <m>h</m> that approaches 0, not <m>x</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      The function <m>f(x)</m> in <xref ref="ex_parabolasaresmooth">Example</xref> is a polynomial,
      one of the most well-behaved functions we have looked at so far,
      and so we expect its derivative to be similarly well-behaved.
      Let's look at a more complicated function and see what happens with its derivative.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_derivativeofabsolutevalue">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x)=|x|</m> is actually a piecewise-defined function
          <me>
            f(x) = \begin{cases}x,\amp  x\geq 0\\ -x, \amp  x \lt 0 \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Away from the break point at <m>x=0</m>, <m>f(x)</m> is linear.
          For <m>x\lt 0</m>, <m>f(x) = -x</m>,
          which has derivative <m>f\,'(x) = -1</m>.
          For <m>x>0</m>, <m>f(x) = x</m>,
          which has derivative <m>f\,'(x) = 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's look specifically at the break point <m>x=0</m> and calculate <m>f\,'(0)</m>.
          <me>
            f\,'(0) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{|0+h|-0}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{|h|}{h}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to simplify further,
          we have to know what to do with <m>|h|</m>.
          When <m>h>0</m>, <m>|h|=h</m>,
          and when <m>h\lt 0</m>, <m>|h| = -h</m>.
          This means that we need to split up the limit into right and left limits in order to finish the calculation,
          since we get a different formula for <m>|h|</m> depending on whether <m>h\to 0^-</m> or <m>h\to 0^+</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{h\to 0^-} \frac{|h|}{h} \amp = \lim_{h\to 0^-} \frac{-h}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0^-} -1 = -1\\ \lim_{h\to 0^+} \frac{|h|}{h} \amp = \lim_{h\to 0^+} \frac{h}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0^+} 1 = 1 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the right and left limits as <m>h\to 0^{\pm}</m> are not equal,
          we conclude that the two-sided limit as <m>h\to 0</m> does not exist:
          <me>
            f\,'(0) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{|h|}{h}  \text{ DNE }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that the derivative <m>f\,'(x)</m> is
          <em>undefined</em> at <m>x=0</m>.
          Summarizing all of the above, we have
          <me>
            f\,'(x) = \begin{cases}1,\amp  x>0\\ \text{ DNE } , \amp  x=0\\ -1, \amp  x\lt 0 \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a function, <m>f\,'(x)</m> has domain <m>x\neq 0</m>,
          or <m>(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)</m>.
          It's interesting to note that this is <em>different</em>
          than the domain of the original function <m>f(x)= |x|</m>,
          which is <m>\mathbb{R} = (-\infty,\infty)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, we see the graph of
          <m>f(x) = |x|</m> with slopes marked for <m>h\lt 0</m> (left) and <m>h>0</m> (middle),
          along with the graph of <m>f\,'(x)</m>
          (right).
          Note that where <m>f(x)</m> is increasing,
          <m>f\,'(x)</m> is positive,
          and where <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing,
          <m>f\,'(x)</m> is negative.
          At <m>x=0</m>,
          the graph of <m>f(x)</m> has a "corner" where there is no clearly defined tangent line,
          while the graph of <m>f\,'(x)</m> has a jump and is undefined at <m>x=0</m>.

      We have seen in the two examples above that,
      given a function <m>f(x)</m> and a value <m>x=a</m>,
      the derivative <m>f\,'(a)</m> may or may not exist,
      meaning there may or may not be a well-defined tangent line to the graph at <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      When <m>f\,'(a)</m> exists,
      there is a well-defined tangent line with a finite slope and we say that <m>f</m> is <em>differentiable</em>
      at <m>x=a</m> (literally "able to be differentiated," meaning "able to take the derivative"):

          Here are pictures of three functions that are <em>not</em>

          In the left graph,
          the derivative at <m>x=2</m> does not exist since the limits as
          <m>h\to 0^{\pm}</m> around <m>x=2</m> will be different.
          From the picture,
          it looks like the left limit may be <m>2</m> while the right limit is <m>-2</m>,
          by examining the slope of each of the lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the middle graph,
          the derivative at <m>x=2</m> also does not exist since the limits as
          <m>h\to 0^{\pm}</m> around <m>x=2</m> will be different.
          It's not clear from the picture whether they are finite or infinite,
          but we can expect the limit as
          <m>h\to 0^-</m> to be negative and the limit as <m>h\to 0^+</m> to be positive.
          This is because the function to the left of <m>x=2</m> is decreasing and the function to the right of <m>x=2</m> is increasing.
          Also, since the function gets steeper as <m>x\to 2^-</m> and <m>x\to 2^+</m>,
          the slopes cannot simply both approach 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the right graph,
          the derivative at <m>x=2</m> is infinite because the tangent line is vertical.
          However, infinite values of a function do not exist since <m>\infty</m> is not a number.

      The precise mathematical distinction between a corner and a cusp is not clear and is different depending on which sources you consult and who you talk to.
      Let's say that a <em>cusp</em> is a point where the two pieces of the curve appear asymptotic to each other,
      while a <em>corner</em> has a nonzero angle between the two pieces of the curve.
      I have seen the two terms used interchangeably and
      <em>you will not be tested on the difference between them.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's see some explicit calculations of derivatives where vertical tangent lines and cusps are involved:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_cuberootofx">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} = x^{1/3}</m> is defined for all values of <m>x</m>.
          Its graph is pictured in <xref ref="fig_cuberootofx" autoname="yes"/> below.
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_cuberootofx">

        </figure>
        <p>
          At <m>x=0</m>, it looks like there is a vertical tangent line.
          Let's confirm this by computing <m>f\,'(0)</m>.
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}f\,'(0) \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}\\ \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(0+h)^{1/3}-0^{1/3}}{h}\\ \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{h^{1/3}}{h}\\ \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h^{2/3}}\\ \amp =\frac{1}{0^+}\\ \amp =\infty \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We know that the limit at the end will be infinite because it has the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>,
          and that it will be positive because
          <m>h^{2/3} = \sqrt[3]{h^2}</m> will be positive for <m>h\to 0^{\pm}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we have confirmed that
          <m>f(x) = x^{1/3}</m> has a vertical tangent line at <m>x=0</m>,
          and so is not differentiable at <m>x=0</m>.
          We will see in later sections that <m>f\,'(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3} = \dfrac{1}{3x^{2/3}}</m>,
          which is undefined when <m>x=0</m>, matching our answer here.

          The function <m>g(x) = \sqrt[3]{x^2}=x^{2/3}</m> is likewise defined for all values of <m>x</m>.

        <p>
          At <m>x=0</m>, it looks like there is a cusp.
          Let's examine the precise way in which <m>g\,'(0)</m> fails to exist:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}g'(0) \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}\\ \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{h^{2/3}}{h}\\ \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h^{1/3}}\\ \amp = \frac{1}{0}\\ \amp = \pm\infty \text{ so does not exist. } \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We know that this last limit will be infinite because it has the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>.
          It will be positive for <m>h\to 0^+</m> and negative for <m>h\to 0^-</m>,
          since <m>h^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{h}</m> will be positive for <m>h>0</m> and negative for <m>h\lt 0</m>.
          Thus the limit from the left is <m>-\infty</m> while the limit from the right is <m>\infty</m>,
          hence the two-sided limit does not exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we have confirmed that
          <m>g(x) = x^{2/3}</m> is not differentiable at <m>x=0</m> since the secant lines from the right and left at <m>0</m> approach different infinitites.
          We will see in later sections that
          <me>
            g\,'(x) = \frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3} = \dfrac{2}{3x^{1/3}}

    <title>Differentiable vs. Continuous</title>
    <p>
      The examples we have seen so far have all been of functions that were continuous for all values of <m>x</m> but were not differentiable at a single point.
      Another way that a function <m>f</m> can fail to be differentiable at a point <m>x=a</m> is if <m>f</m> fails to be continuous at <m>x=a</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a function is not continuous,
      then it has absolutely no chance of being differentiable.
      Think about the different ways that a function can be discontinuous:
      a jump, removable discontinuity (hole), or infinite discontinuity
      (vertical asymptote).
    </p>
    <p>
      At a vertical asymptote or at some holes,
      the function is undefined at <m>x=a</m>.
      If the function is undefined at <m>x=a</m>,
      it cannot have a tangent line at <m>x=a</m>.
      To see this, think of the definition of <m>f\,'(a)</m>:
      <me>
        f\,'(a) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to even begin to calculate this limit,
      we have to be able to use the value <m>f(a)</m> in the numerator.
      If <m>f</m> is undefined at <m>x=a</m>,
      then <m>f(a)</m> does not exist,
      and we can't even write down this definition!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if a function is defined at <m>x=a</m>,
      if it is not continuous, it is still not differentiable.

      A similar thing happens at a hole where the value of the function is different than the limit of the function.

      although not every continuous function is differentiable,
      every differentiable function is continuous.

      \fbox{ The equivalent statement in the theorem above is what's called the <em>contrapositive</em>
      of the original statement.
      In general, the contrapositive of the implication "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P." If an implication is true,
      then its contrapositive is also true. }

          Make sure your contrapositive is also true.

          My example is: "If I spill my coffee,

    <p>
      It's important to notice in Exercise <xref ref="ex_contrapositives" autoname="yes"/> that I can be sad in other ways than spilling my coffee,
      but since spilling my coffee always makes me sad,
      if I'm not sad, at least I know I didn't spill my coffee.
      Likewise, there are other ways than being discontinuous for a function to
      <em>not</em> be differentiable
      (the cusps, corners, and vertical tangent lines that we already saw),
      but since being discontinuous always makes a function not differentiable,
      if our function is differentiable,
      we know it has to be continuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking this analogy even further,
      just because I didn't spill my coffee this morning doesn't mean I won't spill it another morning.
      For a function,
      it can be differentiable at some points and not differentiable at other points.

      Let's use this notion of differentiability to take another look at tangent lines.
      The tangent line to <m>f</m> at a point <m>x=a</m> is defined in terms of the derivative <m>f\,'(a)</m>:

      <statement>
        <p>
          The <em>tangent line</em> to the graph of a function <m>f</m> at a point <m>x=a</m> is defined to be the line passing through
          <m>(a,f(a))</m> with slope <m>f\,'(a)</m>,
          provided that the derivative <m>f\,'(a)</m> exists.
          This line has equation

            y=f\,'(a)(x-a)+f(a)

    </definition>
    <p>
      The equation in <xref ref="def_tangentline" autoname="yes"/> comes from the point-slope equation of a line
      <me>
        y=m(x-x_0)+y_0
      </me>
      where we use the slope <m>m=f'(a)</m> and the point

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          we have seen that the derivative of <m>f(x)=x^2</m> is
          <m>f'(x) = 2x</m>, and so <m>f\,'(3)=6</m>.
          This means that the tangent line to the graph of
          <m>f(x)=x^2</m> at <m>x=3</m> has slope
          <m>f\,'(3)=6</m> and passes through the point where <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=f(3) = 3^2 = 9</m>.
          This line has equation <m>y=6(x-3)+9</m>,

    </example>
    <p>
      When it exists,
      the tangent line to a function <m>f</m> at a point <m>x=a</m> is the unique line that "agrees with" both the height of the function and the slope of the function at <m>x=a</m>.
      This means that near <m>x=a</m> the graph of a function is very close to the graph of its tangent line;
      the graph is "locally linear," meaning linear near the point.
      Therefore we can use the tangent line as a rough approximation to the function <m>f</m> itself near <m>x=a</m>.
      When we use the tangent line to approximate the function near a point,
      we call it the <em>local linearization of <m>f</m> around <m>x=a</m></em> and we write
      <me>
        f(x)\approx L(x) = f\,'(a)(x-a)+f(a)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do we not just use the name "tangent line?" The perspective here is that we are "linearizing", meaning making linear,
      the function <m>f(x)</m> by approximating it by its tangent line.
      The word "local" here is used to mean nearby,
      or in a neighborhood of, the point <m>x=a</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition of the tangent line does not tell us how good an approximation one can make by using the tangent line.
      What constitutes "near" and what constitutes "good" will be determined by the context of the problem at hand.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, since the tangent line to
          <m>f(x) = x^2</m> at <m>x=3</m> is the line <m>y=6x-9</m>,
          the linear equation <m>L(x)=6x-9</m> can be used as a rough approximation to the graph of the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m>,
          at least for values of <m>x</m> close to 3.
          This approximation will be better the closer we are to <m>x=3</m>.
          As the following figure shows,
          the two graphs have nearly the same height at the point <m>x=3.5</m> and are still relatively close even at <m>x=4</m>.

        <p>
          Comparing values,
          <m>L(3.5) = 6(3.5)-9 = 12</m> while <m>f(3.5) = 12.25</m>,
          so <m>L(3.5)\approx f(3.5)</m>.
          The further we get from <m>x=3</m>,
          the farther <m>L(x)</m> and <m>f(x)</m> are from each other,
          and the worse the approximation <m>f(x)\approx L(x)</m> will be.
        </p>

      The linearization can be used to estimate values of a quantity for which we have information about its present value and current rate of change.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose the cost of manufacturing <m>q=180</m> pairs of shoes is
          <m>C(q) = \dollar3,600</m> and the change in cost to produce one more shoe is estimated to be $15 when the company is already producing 180 shoes.
          We can use this information to estimate the cost to produce more or less shoes.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, we can reasonably expect it to cost
          <m>3600+15 = \dollar3615</m> to produce 181 shoes,
          and even that it will cost approximately
          <m>3600+15(2) = \dollar3530</m> to produce 182 shoes.
          We could even expect it to cost
          <m>3600-15 = \dollar3585</m> to produce 179 shoes.
          In terms of the function <m>C(q)</m>, we are saying
          <me>
            C(179) \approx 3585
          </me>
          <me>
            C(181)\approx 3615
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            C(182)\approx 3630
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can we reasonably expect it to cost
          <m>3600+15(50) = \dollar4350</m> to produce <m>180+50 = 230</m> shoes?
          Maybe or maybe not.
          This depends on whether the cost function is linear,
          which maybe it is and maybe it isn't: we don't know.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the language of local linearizations,
          we can approximate the cost function <m>C(q)</m> with its linearization
          <me>
            C(q)\approx 15(q-180)+3600
          </me>
          for values of <m>q</m> near 180,
          but not necessarily for values relatively far from 180, such as 230.

      it will never look like a line that we could describe using an equation of the form <m>y=mx+b</m>.

          and zoom in around the point <m>(1,5)</m> where there is a corner.
          No matter how close you get,
          you will still see the corner,
          so near the point <m>(1,5)</m>,
          there is no linear function <m>y=mx+b</m> that looks the same as the function.

          Use Desmos to graph <m>f(x) = x^{1/3}</m> and zoom in around the point <m>(0,0)</m>.
          The graph does begin to look like a line,
          but there still no linear equation <m>y=mx+b</m> that looks like the graph near <m>(0,0)</m>.
          Why?
          What would <m>m</m> have to be?

      The concept of local linearity is particularly helpful when working with functions in the sciences.
      Many complicated problems are made simpler by estimating functions using their tangent lines.
      The most famous example of this is
      <me>
        \sin x\approx x \text{ for values of \(x\) near }  x=0
      </me>,
      which is used to estimate the value of small vibrations in particles in physics models.
      We will derive this approximation next semester.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    Differentiable and differentiability (the property of being differentiable), vertical tangent line, cusp, corner; local linearization of a function around a point
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Differentiable means the derivative exists,
      or in other words that the tangent line exists, at a point.
      A function is differentiable except where it is not continuous,
      or at cusps,
      corners, or vertical tangent lines.
      When the derivative exists,
      it can be used to estimate values of a function nearby via the tangent line,
      called the local linearization of the function at the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      Derivatives of piecewise-defined functions are tricky because we have to check continuity at break-points before knowing whether there is a derivative at that point.
      It's not clear at the moment exactly how to take derivatives at the break-point if the function is continuous,
      except if there is an obvious corner that causes the derivative to be undefined.
