    <title>The Derivative as Instantaneous Rate of Change</title>
    <p>
      The <em>instantaneous rate of change</em>
      of a function is an idea that sits at the foundation of calculus.
      It is a generalization of the notion of instantaneous velocity and measures how fast a particular function is changing at a given point.
      If the original function represents the position of a moving object,
      this instantaneous rate of change is precisely the velocity of the object.
      In other contexts,
      instantaneous rate of change could measure the number of cells added to a bacteria culture per day,
      the change in fuel efficiency resulting from increasing a car's speed,
      or the increase in a mortgage payment for each percentage point increase in interest rate.
      The instantaneous rate of change can also be interpreted geometrically on the function's graph,
      and this connection is fundamental to many of the main ideas in calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall from Section <xref ref="sec_avgchange" autoname="yes"/> that for a moving object with position function <m>s(t)</m>,
      its <em>average velocity</em> on the time interval from <m>t=a</m> to <m>t=b</m> is given by the quotient
      <me>
        AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}
      </me>.
      If we look at an interval starting at <m>t=a</m> and ending at <m>t=a+h</m>,
      then this formula becomes
      <me>
        AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{(a+h)-a}
      </me>.
      The denominator can simplify by cancelling the <m>a</m>'s, and so we arrive at the formula:
      <me>
        AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}
      </me>.
      This represents the average velocity of an object starting at time <m>t=a</m> and measuring over a time interval of length <m>h</m>.
      We can estimate the <em>instantaneous velocity</em>
      of the object at <m>t=a</m> by taking smaller and smaller values of <m>h</m> for the width of the interval.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_fallingballaveragevelocitylimits">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that the height <m>s</m> of a ball at time <m>t</m>
          (in seconds)
          is given in feet by the formula <m>s(t) = 64-16(t-1)^2</m>.
          A graph of <m>s(t)</m> for <m>0\leq t\leq 3</m> is:

        <p>
          <image width="46%" source="ACPrev1-1-1Graph.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's find the average velocity of the ball on intervals approaching <m>t=0.8</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          On <m>[0.8,1.2]</m>, the average velocity is
          <me>
            AV_{[0.8,1.2]} = \frac{s(1.2)-s(0.8)}{1.2-0.8} = \frac{63.36-63.36}{0.4} = 0 \text{ ft/sec. }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this average velocity is on an interval of length <m>h=0.4</m> starting at <m>t=0.8</m>.
          The ball has zero <em>average</em> velocity,
          but we know from the graph that the ball is not stationary during this interval.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we calculate the average velocity on <m>[0.8,0.9]</m>,
          <m>[0.8,0.81]</m>, <m>[0.8,0.801]</m>, and <m>[0.8,0.8001]</m>,
          corresponding to <m>h=0.1, 0.01</m>,
          and <m>0.001</m>, as well,
          we have the average rates of change in <xref ref="tab_fallingballavgvelocitiesrightlimit" autoname="yes"/> on intervals that approach the time <m>t=0.8</m>.

          Notice that we can't use our average velocity formula to calculate the exact instantaneous velocity at time <m>t=0.8</m>,
          as <m>AV_{[0.8,0.8]}</m> is undefined.
          However, the table above leads us to think that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at <m>t=0.8</m> seconds is probably very close to 6.4 ft/sec.
        </p>
        <p>
          What were we doing in the previous calculations?
          We were taking the limit as <m>h\to 0</m> of <m>AV_{[0.8,0.8+h]}</m>.
          Note however that we only used <em>positive</em> values for <m>h</m>,
          so really we were taking <m>h\to 0^+</m>.
          Let's see what happens when we consider <m>h\to 0^-</m>.

        <p>
          On <m>[0.4,0.8]</m>, the average velocity is

            AV_{[0.4,0.8]} = \frac{s(0.8)-s(0.4)}{0.8-0.4} = \frac{63.36-58.24}{0.4} = 12.8 \text{ ft/sec. }

          On this interval,

          <em>prior to</em> <m>t=0.8</m>.

          Moreover, let's remember how we can interpret average velocities visually:
          <m>AV_{[0.4,0.8]}</m> is the slope of the line segment between the points
          <m>(0.4,s(0.4))</m> and <m>(0.8,s(0.8))</m>.
          As the interval gets smaller,
          the line segment gets shorter and the slope approaches the velocity at <m>t=0.8</m>.

          Experiment with the Desmos graph

        <p>
          Use the slider for <m>h</m> to move the point at
          <m>(b,s(b))</m> closer and farther from <m>t=0.8</m>,
          to see how the slope of this line changes.
          From our work above,
          we know that the slope of the line "at <m>t=0.8</m>" is approximately 6.4, even though Desmos tells us that it's undefined.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we zoom in very close to the point
          <m>(0.8,s(0.8))</m> on the Desmos graph above,
          note that the graph appears straighter and straighter.
          In fact, it gets closer and closer to the orange line as long as <m>h</m> is small enough.
          Try setting <m>h=0.001</m> and zooming in very close to <m>(0.8,s(0.8))</m> to see this.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      In a similar way,
      we make the following definition for an arbitrary function <m>y=f(x)</m>:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For a function <m>f</m>,
          the <em>average rate of change</em>
          of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> is given by the value
          <me>
            AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      It is essential that you understand how the average rate of change of <m>f</m> on an interval is connected to its graph,
      so we review this concept from <xref ref="sec_avgchange">Section</xref>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>f</m> is the function given by the graph below and that <m>a</m> and <m>a+h</m> are the input values as labeled on the <m>x</m>-axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="46%" source="ACPrev1-3-1Graph.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          The points <m>(a,f(a))</m> and
          <m>(a+h,f(a+h))</m> are labeled in red on the graph.
          We draw a line segment between these two points,
          and from it construct a right triangle whose hypotenuse is the line segment between the points and whose legs are parallel to the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="46%" source="ACPrev1-3-1GraphwTriangle.pdf"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          The base of the triangle has length
          <m>h=(a+h)-a</m> and the height of the triangle has length <m>f(a+h)-f(a)</m>.
          Thus the slope of the line segment connecting
          <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(a+h,f(a+h))</m> is
          <me>
            \frac{\text{ rise } }{\text{ run } } = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}=\dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}
          </me>
          where we can use the notation <m>\Delta f</m>,
          read "delta <m>f</m>", to represent the
          <em>change in <m>\mathbf{f}</m></em> and <m>\Delta x</m>,
          read "delta <m>x</m>", to represent the
          <em>change in <m>\mathbf{x}</m></em>
          as a quick way of writing these quantities.
          They will be extremely important for our study of rates of change.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Just as we defined instantaneous velocity in terms of average velocity,
      we now define the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point in terms of the average rate of change of the function <m>f</m> over related intervals.
      This instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> at <m>x=a</m> is called
      <em>the derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>x=a</m></em>,
      and is denoted by <m>f\,'(a)</m>,
      which is pronounced "<m>f</m>-prime of <m>a</m>". Another common notation for <m>f\,'(a)</m> is
      <me>
        f\,'(a) =  \frac{df}{dx}\Big|_{x=a}
      </me>
      which is pronounced "dee <m>f</m> dee <m>x</m> at <m>x</m> equal to <m>a</m>." This is called Leibniz notation,
      after the mathematician Gottfried Leibniz.<fn>
      <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz</url>
      Leibniz is credited as one of the inventors of calculus.
      Isaac Newton is the other,
      and the two of them did not agree about their approach to the subject,
      so we have two different sets of notation (Leibniz notation and prime notation,
      developed by Newton).

    <title>The Derivative as the Slope of the Tangent Line</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we consider the derivative at a given value as the slope of a certain line,
      which we will call the <em>tangent line</em>.
      What exactly is a tangent line?
      Read on<ellipsis/>
    </p>
    <p>
      When we compute an instantaneous rate of change,
      we allow the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> to shrink as <m>h\to 0</m>.
      We can think of one endpoint of the interval as "sliding towards" the other.
      In particular,
      provided that <m>f</m> has a derivative at <m>(a,f(a))</m>,
      the point <m>(a+h,f(a+h))</m> will approach <m>(a,f(a))</m> as <m>h\to 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On each interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> there is a line through the two points
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(a+h,f(a+h))</m>.
      This line is called a <em>secant line</em>.
      A secant line to a curve is simply a line that passes through two points on the curve.
      The line that these secant lines approach as <m>h\to 0</m> is the tangent line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture below shows a sequence of figures with several different lines through the points
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(a+h, f(a+h))</m>,
      generated by different values of <m>h</m>.

      (shown in the first three figures in magenta),
      are the secant lines to the curve <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      For each such line,
      the slope of the secant line is <m>m=\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m>,
      where the value of <m>h</m> depends on the location of the point we choose.
      We can see in the diagram how, as <m>h\to 0</m>,
      the secant lines start to approach the single line that passes through the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      If the limit of the slopes of the secant lines exists,
      we say that the resulting value is the
      <em>slope of the tangent line to the curve</em>.
      This <em>tangent line</em>
      (shown in the right-most figure in green)
      to the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> at the point
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> has slope <m>m=f\,'(a)</m>.

      to explore this idea.
      You can drag the points around on the graph,
      adjust the slider for <m>x=a</m> to change the point where you're taking the derivative,
      adjust the slider for <m>h</m> to change how far apart the points are,
      and even change the function that you're taking the derivative of.
      It also tells you the value <m>m</m> of the slope of the line between the points.

      In the picture below we combine the four graphs in the picture above into the single one on the left,
      and zoom in on the box centered at <m>(a,f(a))</m> on the right.
      Note how the tangent line sits relative to the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at

      A function is differentiable precisely when the tangent line is close to the curve when viewed up close.

        <p>
          Estimate the slope of the line tangent to the graph of <m>f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x^2+3x</m> at the point
          <m>(2,f(2))</m> by calculating a sequence of slopes of secant lines.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The tangent line passes through the point
          <m>(2,f(2)) = (2,4)</m> since <m>f(2) = -\frac{1}{2}(2)^2+3(2)=4</m>.
          It is shown in red in each of the graphs that follow.
          Since we only know one point on this line,
          we cannot compute its slope directly.
          We will approximate its slope by considering a sequence of slopes of secant lines on smaller and smaller intervals,
          namely <m>[2,3], [2,2.5], [2,2.25]</m>,
          and <m>[2,2.1]</m>, as shown in the graphs below:
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="73%" source="TaalmanPage170a.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the definition of the derivative,
          we can think of this as a sequence of <m>h</m>-values <m>h=1, h=0.5, h=0.25</m>,
          and <m>h=0.1</m> approaching zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          The slope of the secant line from <m>x=2</m> to <m>x=3</m> in the leftmost graph is given by
          <me>
            \frac{f(3)-f(2)}{3-2} = \frac{\left(-\frac{1}{2}(3)^2+3(3)\right)-\left(-\frac{1}{2}(2)^2+3(2)\right)}{3-2} = \frac{4.5-4}{3-2} = 0.5
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the slopes of the remaining three secant lines are given by
          <me>
            \frac{f(2.5)-f(2)}{2.5-2}=0.75,  \frac{f(2.25)-f(2)}{2.25-2}=0.875,  \text{ and }  \frac{f(2.1)-f(2)}{2.1-2}=0.95
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of these slopes is an approximation to the slope of the red tangent line.
          As the graphs shown suggest,
          we would expect this sequence of slopes to be getting closer and closer to the actual slope of the red tangent line;
          notice for example that, in the last figure shown,
          the green secant line is almost indistinguishable from the red tangent line.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a similar fashion we can calculate the slopes of secant lines from the left of <m>x=2</m>.
          For example,
          the slope of the secant line from <m>x=1</m> to <m>x=2</m> is given by
          <me>
            \frac{f(1)-f(2)}{1-2} = \frac{\left(-\frac{1}{2}(1)^2+3(1)\right)-\left(-\frac{1}{2}(2)^2+3(2)\right)}{1-2} = \frac{2.5-4}{1-2} = 1.5
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the smaller intervals <m>[1,5,2], [1.75,2]</m>,
          and <m>[1.9,2]</m> we have secant lines with slopes given by
          <me>
            \frac{f(1.5)-f(2)}{1.5-2}=1.25,  \frac{f(1.75)-f(2)}{1.75-2}=1.125, \text{ and }  \frac{f(1.9)-f(2)}{1.9-2} = 1.05
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting all this information together,
          we obtain the following table:

          From this table,
          we might guess that the slope of the tangent line is 1.
          This guess is only an estimate;
          the slope of the tangent line might instead be something like 0.97 or 1.02,

    <title>The Derivative as an Associated Slope Function</title>
    <p>
      Let's see another approach at visualizing the derivative.
      Intuitively speaking,
      if the graph of a function <m>f</m> is <em>smooth</em>
      on an interval <m>(a,b)</m>,
      meaning that it does not have any corners, cusps, jumps,
      or holes,
      then at every point <m>(x,f(x))</m> on the graph of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>(a,b)</m> we can consider the direction,
      or <em>slope</em>, of the function at that point.
      What we really mean by this is that we consider the slope of the tangent line at that point.
    </p>
    <example>

        <p>
          For example, in the figure that follows,
          the tangent line drawn at <m>x=-1</m> points in the same direction as the function <m>f</m> at <m>(-1, f(-1))</m>.
          More precisely,
          if you imagine yourself in a tiny car driving along the graph of <m>f</m> with your headlights on,
          then that line represents the direction that your headlights are pointing when you reach the point
          <m>(-1,f(-1))</m> from the right or left.
          Similarly, the line drawn at <m>x=4</m> represents the direction of the graph of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(4,f(4))</m>.

          We can use the graph of a smooth function <m>f</m> to define a new function whose output at each point <m>x</m> is the slope of the tangent line at <m>x</m>.

          the slopes shown on the graph of <m>f</m> in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage164bc" autoname="yes"/> on the left are used to define heights on the graph of the

          A good place to begin is by marking all the locations on the graph of <m>f</m> where the tangent line is horizontal and thus has slope 0.
          In this case that happens at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>,
          as shown next at the left.

          (see, for example, the positive slope marked at <m>x=1</m>).
          This means that, in the graph of <m>f\,'</m>,
          the heights will be positive between <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
          Similarly, the negative slopes on the graph of <m>f</m> to the left of <m>x=0</m> and to the right of <m>x=2</m> correspond to negative heights on the graph of <m>f\,'</m>.

          Draw the associated slope function for the graph below.
          Meaning, if the curve below is the graph of <m>y=s(t)</m>,
          draw <m>s\,'(t)</m> by considering the slopes of the tangent lines to <m>s(t)</m> at different values of <m>t</m>.

      Since we began this section with an example of finding the velocity of an object given its position function,
      let's end by revisiting this application.
      In the language we have developed in this section, we can now say that
    </p>
    "Velocity is the derivative of position."

      <title>Graphing Velocity from Position</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that the graph that follows describes your distance from home one morning as you drive back and forth from your sister's house.
          Describe a possible scenario for your travels that morning.
          Then sketch the corresponding graph of your velocity.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          One possible scenario is this: You drive to your sister's house for a visit.
          After talking to her for a few minutes,
          you realize you forgot something at home and race back to get it.
          In the middle of returning to your sister's house,
          you have to stop at a red light for a couple of minutes.
          Following the times marked on the time axis,
          we see that from 0 to <m>a</m> you drive to your sister's house,
          you talk until <m>b</m>, race home from <m>b</m> to <m>c</m>,
          leave your house at <m>d</m> and get stopped at the light at <m>e</m>,
          and move on at <m>f</m> until you get back to your sister's house at <m>g</m>.

        <p>
          The graph of your velocity that morning is the graph of the associated slope function for the given position graph.
          The slope of the position graph is positive from 0 to <m>a</m>,
          zero from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>,
          negative and steep from <m>b</m> to <m>c</m>,
          zero from <m>c</m> to <m>d</m>,
          positive and steep from <m>d</m> to <m>e</m>,
          zero from <m>e</m> to <m>f</m>,
          positive and steep from <m>f</m> to <m>g</m>,
          and finally zero again after <m>g</m>.
          The previous sentence also describes the height of the corresponding velocity graph,
          where steep slope values correspond to large magnitudes of velocity:

          In your own words,
          explain how to graph the derivative function (a.k.a. associated slope function) from the graph of a function
          (with just a picture, not a formula for the function).

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    instantaneous rate of change, instantaneous velocity, average rate of change on an interval <m>[a,a+h]</m>; <m>\Delta f</m>, meaning the change in <m>f</m>, and <m>\Delta x</m>, meaning the change in <m>x</m>; the derivative of a function at a point; the tangent line to a function at a point, secant line, slope of the tangent line to the curve; a smooth function, associated slope function, derivative function
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The derivative of <m>f</m> at the value <m>x=a</m> is defined as the limit of the average rate of change of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> as <m>h\to 0</m>.
      Because the quantity <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m> represents the slope of the line through
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(a+h,f(a+h))</m>,
      when we compute the derivative we are taking the limit of a collection of slopes of lines.
      Thus the derivative itself represents the slope of a particularly important line,
      the tangent line.
      For each <m>x</m>,
      the slope of the tangent line to <m>f(x)</m> is the height of <m>f\,'(x)</m>.
      Where the graph of <m>f</m> is increasing,
      the derivative <m>f\,'</m> is above the <m>x</m>-axis.
      Where the graph of <m>f</m> is decreasing,
      the derivative <m>f\,'</m> is below the <m>x</m>-axis.
      Where <m>f</m> has a horizontal tangent line,
      the derivative <m>f\,'</m> has a <m>x</m>-intercept.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      The limit defining the derivative of <m>f</m> at the value <m>x=a</m> may not exist,
      so not every function has a derivative at every point.
      We say that a function is <em>differentiable</em>
      at <m>x=a</m> if it has a derivative at <m>x=a</m>.
      We will explore this concept more in a later section.
