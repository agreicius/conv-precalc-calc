    <title>Definition of Continuity</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        What do you think of when you hear the word "continuous?" A quick Google search will tell you that <em>continuous</em>
        is an adjective that means
      </p>
      <em>forming an unbroken whole; without interruption.</em>
      <p>
        In this section,
        we define what it means for a function to be continuous,
        or to "have continuity."
      </p>
      <example xml:id="ex_continuity">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the graph of the function
            <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x+3</m> below and the limit <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)</m>.
          </p>
          <figure xml:id="fig_taalmanpage125a">
            <caption>The graph of <m>f(x) =  \frac{1}{2}x+3</m>. What is <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)</m>?</caption>
            <image width="37%" source="altTaalmanPage125a.png"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The limit asks us to consider what value the function
            <m>f(x)= \frac{1}{2}x+3</m> approaches as <m>x</m> approaches 2.
            We can see in the picture that the <m>y</m>-values of the function approach 4, and that this is also what we get when we evaluate the function at 2 since <m>f(2) = \frac{1}{2}(2)+3 = 1+3 = 4</m>.
            For this limit and this function, it is the case that
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 2}f(x) = f(2)=4
            </me>
            so that taking the limit is the same as evaluating the function.
            There is a particular name for this situation where the value of the limit is the same as the function's value:
            such a function is called <em>continuous</em>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>
        Visually, a function is <em>continuous</em>
        if its graph has no breaks, jumps, or holes.
        Loosely speaking,
        you can sketch the graph of a continuous function "without picking up your pencil."

            Visually, we notice the "gaps" in all three graphs at <m>x=1</m>.
            The left-most function <m>g(x)</m> in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage125b" autoname="yes"/> has a "jump" at <m>x=1</m>.
            The left limit approaches 1 while the right limit approaches 2.
            The middle function <m>h(x)</m> in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage125c" autoname="yes"/> and the right function <m>k(x)</m> in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage125d" autoname="yes"/> have "holes" at <m>x=1</m>.
            All three graphs have "interruptions" at <m>x=1</m>,

        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>
        The algebraic notation of limits makes the idea of continuity more precise.
        A function is continuous at a point <m>x=c</m> if its limit as <m>x\to c</m> is equal to a real number that is the same as the value of the function at <m>x=c</m>.

        The functions that we will work with are almost always continuous,
        meaning that they are continuous at almost all points except for a few isolated points where they are discontinuous.
        Thus it makes sense for us to define what it means for a function to be continuous on an interval of points,
        rather than just point-by-point.

      <definition>
        <title>Continuity of a Function on an Interval</title>
        <statement>

            A function <m>f</m> is <em>continuous on an interval</em>
            <m>(a,b)</m> if it is continuous for every point <m>x=c</m> with <m>a\lt c\lt b</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We say that a function is <em>continuous on its domain</em>
            if it is continuous on every interval on which it is defined.

            A function <m>f</m> is <em>continuous from the left at <m>x=c</m></em>, a.k.a.
            <em>left-continuous</em>, if

        We can use interval notation to express whether a function is right or left continuous at the edges of an interval.

            The graphs that follow provide examples of continuity on the four possible types of bounded intervals.

            For example,
            a function <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[1,3)</m> if it is continuous at every point in the interior <m>(1,3)</m> and continuous from the right at the left endpoint <m>x=1</m>,
            as shown in the second from left picture above.
            This is because the left endpoint is closed on the graph so that the left limit
            <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 1^+}f(x)</m> at the left endpoint equals the value of the function <m>f(1)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            By contrast,
            the right-most picture above is continuous on <m>[1,3]</m> since both endpoints are closed,
            so the right limit at <m>x=1</m> matches <m>f(1)</m>,
            while the left limit at <m>x=3</m> matches <m>f(3)</m>.
            This function is right-continuous at <m>x=1</m> and left-continuous at <m>x=3</m>.

            Remember that the closed endpoint on the interval

    <title>Types of Discontinuities</title>
    <p>
      When a function is not continuous at a point <m>x=c</m>,
      we say that it is <em>discontinuous</em> at <m>x=c</m>.
      In terms of limits this means that
    </p>
    the limit <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c}f(x)</m> is not equal to the value <m>f(c)</m>.
    <p>
      The three types of discontinuities that a function can have are illustrated as follows:
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_taalmanpage126b">
      <caption>The three types of discontinuities.</caption>
      <image width="92.5%" source="TaalmanPage126b.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In the left-most picture,
      we see that the function is discontinuous at <m>x=2</m> because <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 2}f(x) = 1</m> while <m>f(2)=2</m>.
      This is called a <em>removable discontinuity</em>.
      Intuitively,
      we say that a discontinuity is removable if we could get rid of the discontinuity just by changing one value of the function.
      This type of discontinuity is also called a <em>hole</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle picture,
      we can see that the function is discontinuous at <m>x=2</m> because the left and right limits are different,
      so <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 2}f(x)</m> does not exist.
      When the left and right limits both exist but are not equal,
      this is called a <em>jump discontinuity</em>.
      Here, <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x) = 1</m> and
      <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 2^+}f(x) = 2</m> both exist, but are not equal.
      At a jump discontinuity, the function jumps from one value to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the right-most picture,
      we see that the function is discontinuous at <m>x=2</m> because <m>f(2)</m> is undefined and the limit is not finite,
      and so does not exist.
      Anytime a left or right limit is infinite,
      we call this an <em>infinite discontinuity</em>.
      Infinite discontinuities are also called
      <em>vertical asymptotes</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize,
      these types of discontinuities can be described precisely in terms of limits as follows:

          What type of discontinuity does the function

        <p>
          Without looking at the picture,
          notice that as <m>x\to 1^-</m>,
          the piece of the function given by <m>4-x^2</m> approaches <m>3</m> algebraically:
          <me>
            \text{ as } x\to 1^-, 4-x^2\to 4-(1)^2 = 3
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, as <m>x\to 1^+</m>,
          the piece of the function given by <m>x-1</m> approaches <m>0</m> algebraically:
          <me>

          Thus we can see algebraically that the function has a jump at <m>x=1</m>.

    <title>Rules for Calculating Limits</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Now we know that limits of continuous function are easy to evaluate:
        we simply plug in the <m>x</m>-value of the limit to the formula,
        the same way we would if we just wanted to know the value of the function.
        In this section,
        we build up a list of functions that we know to be continuous.
        We begin with the simplest functions:
        constant and linear functions:
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm_contlinearfunctions">
        <title>Continuity of Linear Functions</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Constant and linear functions are continuous for all <m>x</m>-values:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  For any real numbers <m>k</m> and <m>c</m>,
                  <me>
                    \lim_{x\to c}k = k
                  </me>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  For any real numbers <m>c, m</m>, and <m>b</m>,
                  <me>
                    \lim_{x\to c}(mx+b) = mc+b
                  </me>
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        Now we know that for any constant or any linear function,
        evaluating a limit is no different than evaluating the function.
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm_contpowerfunctions">
        <title>Continuity of Power Functions</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Power functions are continuous on their domains:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  For any real number <m>A</m> and rational number <m>k</m>,
                  then for any values <m>x=c</m> for which <m>x^k</m> is defined,
                  <me>
                    \lim_{x\to c} Ax^k = Ac^k
                  </me>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        They key difference in Theorem <xref ref="thm_contpowerfunctions" autoname="yes"/> is that power functions are sometimes undefined,
        and so cannot be continuous where they are not defined,
        meaning outside of their domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are powerful theorems,
        because it tells us that we can calculate limits of certain simple functions at domain points just by evaluating the functions at those points.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            For example,
            <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}</m> is a power function,
            so by Theorem <xref ref="thm_contpowerfunctions" autoname="yes"/>,
            it is continuous on its domain,
            which is <m>(-\infty,0)\cup(0\infty)</m>.
            This means that at any point <m>c\neq 0</m> we can calculate
            <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c}\frac{1}{x}</m> by simply calculating the value <m>f(c) = \frac{1}{c}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance,
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 5}\frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{5}
            </me>
            and
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to -17}\frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{-17}
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we <em>cannot</em> yet compute <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x}</m>.
            We will examine this limit in depth in a later section.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The function <m>f(x) = 2</m> is constant.
            Hence using Theorem <xref ref="thm_contlinearfunctions" autoname="yes"/>, we know that
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 3} 2 = 2
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The function <m>g(x) = x</m> is linear,
            so again using Theorem <xref ref="thm_contlinearfunctions" autoname="yes"/>, we know that
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 5} x = 5
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            The function <m>h(x) = \sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}</m> is a power function,
            so using Theorem <xref ref="thm_contpowerfunctions" autoname="yes"/>, we know that
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 16} \sqrt{x} = \lim_{x\to 16} x^{1/2} = (16)^{1/2} = \sqrt{16} = 4

        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>
        In Theorem <xref ref="thm_contpowerfunctions" autoname="yes"/>, the limit may sometimes be only one-sided.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            For example,
            <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}</m> is defined at <m>x=0</m> and for <m>x>0</m>,
            meaning to the right of <m>x=0</m>.
            However it is not defined for <m>x\lt 0</m>,
            meaning to the left of <m>x=0</m>.
            Therefore the corresponding limit statement is one-sided:
            <me>
              \ds\lim_{x\to 0^+} \sqrt{x} = 0 \text{ but }  \ds\lim_{x\to 0^-}\sqrt{x} \text{ DNE, } \text{ hence }  \lim_{x\to 0}\sqrt{x}\text{ DNE. }

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Limits of Combinations of Functions</title>
      <p>
        What about more complicated functions?
        Can we put together two continuous functions and still have a continuous function?
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            For example,
            we already know from the continuity of power functions that

              \lim_{x\to 2}x^2 = 2^2 = 4\text{ and } \lim_{x\to 2}x^3 = 2^3 = 8
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Can we use these results to say something about

        The key theorem that follows in Theorem <xref ref="thm_limitrules" autoname="yes"/> will help us answer this question;

        This theorem is a powerful tool for calculating limits,
        since it tells us how to find limits of compound functions in terms of the limits of their components.

            For example, we can now calculate the limit of the <em>sum</em>
            <m>x^2+x^3</m> as <m>x\to 2</m> by taking the sum of the limits of <m>x^2</m> and <m>x^3</m> as <m>x\to 2</m>:

              \lim_{x\to 2}(x^2+x^3) = \lim_{x\to 2}x^2+\lim_{x\to 2}x^3 = 2^2+2^3 = 4+8=12

        An immediate consequence of <xref ref="thm_limitrules">Theorem</xref>

            For example, since <m>f(x)=x^2</m> and

            we know that <m>(f+g)(x) = f(x)+g(x) = x^2+x^3</m> must also be continuous at <m>x=2</m>.
            This makes sense given <xref ref="thm_limitrules">Theorem</xref> since
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 2} (f+g)(x) = \lim_{x\to 2} (x^2+x^3) = \lim_{x\to 2} x^2+\lim_{x\to 2} x^3 = 2^2+2^3 = 4+8=12=(f+g)(2)

        What is the point of these rules and theorems?
        We now know that we can start with linear and power functions,
        and build up to any <em>algebraic</em><fn>
        Recall that a function is <em>algebraic</em>
        if it can be expressed with the use of only arithmetic operations (<m>+,-, \times, \div</m>) and rational powers.
        </fn> function via sums,
        differences, multiplication, division, or composition,
        and that the resulting function will be continuous as long as it is defined.
        In other words,
        as long as we stay within the domain of an algebraic function,
        we know that in order to evaluate the limit, we just plug it in.
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm_contofalgebraicfunctions">
        <title>Continuity of Algebraic Functions</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            All algebraic functions are continuous on their domains.

          <p>
            In particular,
            if <m>x=c</m> is in the domain of an algebraic function <m>f</m>,

        <em>Caution!</em> We have to be careful at the edge of a function's domain.
        The limits can only be one-sided.

      <example>

            </me>
            since if <m>x\to 2^-</m>,

            We cannot take the limit on this side because the function is undefined,

      <p>
        Note that Theorem <xref ref="thm_contofalgebraicfunctions" autoname="yes"/> does not tell us how to calculate limits at non-domain points.
        For example,
        we still do not know how to calculate <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 2}\frac{1}{x-2}</m>
        (though maybe you have a guess).
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We do not know how to calculate
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to -2} \frac{2-x}{4-x^2}\text{ or }  \lim_{x\to 2} \frac{2-x}{4-x^2}
            </me>
            since those <m>x</m>-values are not in the domain of <m>\frac{2-x}{4-x^2}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nor do we know how to calculate
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{2x^2+x-3}{x-1}
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, since <m>x^3+3\leq 0</m> for <m>x\leq -\sqrt[3]{3}</m>,
            the expression <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^3+3}}</m> is undefined,
            so we do not know how to calculate
            <me>
              \lim_{x\to -\sqrt[3]{3}^+} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^3+3}}
            </me>.
            Note that for <m>x\lt  -\sqrt[3]{3}</m>,
            the expression <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^3+3}}</m> is undefined so any limit will simply fail to exist.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>
        <em>Key Take-away:</em> The only limits we have to "worry" about are at non-domain points of algebraic functions,
        and also the points of piecewise-defined functions where algebraic functions have been glued together and may or may not have jumps.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    continuous and continuity of functions at a point and on an interval; continuous from the right and continuous from the left; discontinuous and discontinuity; removable discontinuity a.k.a. hole; jump discontinuity; infinite discontinuity a.k.a vertical asymptote
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> A function is continuous if the value of a limit is the same as the value of the function.
      This means the graph has no breaks.
      At a point of discontinuity,
      you can either have a hole, jump, or vertical asymptote.
      Algebraic functions are continuous on their domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      We need other methods to evaluate limits at non-domain points.
