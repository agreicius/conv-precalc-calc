    <title>Review: Problem Solving Framework</title>
    <p>
      Since we are about to solve a lot of word problems,
      let's take a moment to review the problem solving framework introduced in <xref ref="sec_problemsolving" autoname="yes"/>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <title>1.
        Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)</title>
        <p>
          Here are some possible things to do to help you understand the problem.
          You don't need to necessarily do all of them or to do them in a particular order.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Read it over once.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Visualize if possible:
              draw a diagram or picture, or sketch a rough graph.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Focus on what is being asked: What is the unknown information or the goal of the problem?
              What information is known?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Identify different quantities that might be relevant.
              Are they constant?
              Are they variables?
              Are they parameters?
            </p>

              Define notation and variables.
              Translate known and unknown information into notation and variables.

      <li>
        <title>2.
        Make a Plan</title>
        <p>
          In this step,
          the big point is to slow down and allow yourself to think versus trying to rely on a memorized approach.
          You brainstorm what could be relevant or useful to know or to do,
          and then make a plan to do it.
          You can actually carry out the plan in the next step.
          Here are some questions to help you.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                What connections or relationships are there between known and unknown quantities?
                Does one change with the other?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                What math tools, concepts, or formulas might be relevant?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Would making a table, function formula or graph be useful?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Is this like any familiar problem?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        Then
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Read over the problem again and decide which of the tools,
              relationships,
              are actually relevant and useful and make a step-by-step plan to use them.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <em>Note:</em> Your plan might not be the same as another person's.
        There are many pathways to solve a problem!
        Also, you may have done some work in "Meet the Problem" that helps you make a plan.
        These two steps are very connected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>3.
        Carry out Your Plan</title>
        <p>
          In this step,
          you actually do the work of the plan, computing a value,
          graphing, solving an equation or whatever you planned.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Along the way, look back at what you planned.
                Are you on track?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Do you need to modify your plan?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>4.
        Reflect Back (Looking Back)</title>
        <p>
          In this step, we look back to see if we've solved the problem,
          check our work and think about what we've learned.
          Here are some questions to help you.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Have you answered the question(s)?
              </p>

              <p>
                Does the answer fit your intuition?
                What surprised you, if anything?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

      </li>
      <li>
        <title>5.
        Critique and Change the Problem</title>
        <p>
          This is an optional step,
          but it is a great way to exercise your critical thinking,
          get curious and creative,
          and think about how the problem might connect to more real-world situations.

            <li>
              <p>
                Were assumptions made in the problem?

    <title>Rates of Change that are Related</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we consider situations where several changing quantities are related,
      but where each quantity is implicitly a function of time,
      which will be represented by the variable <m>t</m>.
      If two quantities that change over time are related to each other,
      then their rates of change over time will also be related to each other.
      In particular,
      this is true even when one of the quantities is not an explicit function of the other,
      and so we can use the ideas developed from implicit differentiation in the previous section to study the derivatives of related quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do we mean when we say that
      <em>two quantities are related?</em>
      This simply means that there is some equation that they satisfy.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the area <m>A</m> and the radius <m>r</m> of a circle are related by the equation
          <me>
            A=\pi r^2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The circumference <m>C</m> and the radius of a circle are also related,
          and satisfy the equation
          <me>
            C=2\pi r
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="ex_legsoftriangle">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The lengths <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> of the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse of length 7 inches are also related to each other.
          In particular, they are related via the Pythagorean Theorem:
          <me>
            a^2+b^2 = 7^2
          </me>
          where since we are told the length of the hypotenuse,
          we include that information in the relationship.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Through knowing how quantities are related,
      we are interested in determining how their respective rates of change with respect to time are related.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Ripples in a Pond</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A stone dropped in a pond creates circular ripples that spread out from the center where the stone was dropped.
          If the radius of a particular circle is increasing at a constant rate of half a foot per second,
          we can ask how fast the area inside the circle is increasing at the moment the radius is 3 feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Meet the Problem:</em> Having read the problem,
          we begin by drawing a diagram of a circle with radius <m>r</m>,
          including an arrow indicating that the radius is increasing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="28%" source="TaalmanPage223.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem involves the area <m>A</m> of the circle as well.
          The quantities <m>A</m> and <m>r</m> are not just variables,
          but are also functions <m>A(t)</m> and <m>r(t)</m> of time since the problem suggests that they are changing.
          We are told that when <m>r=3</m>,
          the radius is changing at a positive rate of 0.5 ft/sec.
          We can write this mathematically as <m>\frac{dr}{dt}=0.5</m>.
          Note that the derivative is respect to <m>t</m> because the rate describes how <m>r</m> changes over <em>time</em>.
          We are asked to find how fast the area is changing,
          again inferring that we are measuring over time,
          meaning we wish to find <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Make a Plan:</em> We know that <m>A</m> and <m>r</m> are related by <m>A=\pi r^2</m>.
          If we take the derivative with respect to <m>t</m> (NOT <m>r</m>;
          see emphasis on using <m>t</m> as the independent variable in the previous paragraph),
          then we will know how <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m> are related.
          We expect to need to plug in the information that we are given and then arrive at a number for <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Carry out Your Plan:</em>
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dt}[A] \amp = \frac{d}{dt}[\pi r^2]\\ \frac{dA}{dt} \amp = \pi \left(2r\,\frac{dr}{dt}\right)\\ \frac{dA}{dt} \amp = 2\pi r\, \frac{dr}{dt} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that we have used that <m>A</m> and <m>r</m> are implicit functions of <m>t</m>,
          and so have needed to use the chain rule when taking the derivative <m>\frac{d}{dt}[r^2] = 2r\,\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point,
          we have "related the rates" of changes of the area and the radius,
          <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.
          Then if we remember that we are given <m>r=3</m> and <m>\frac{dr}{dt} = 0.5</m>,
          we can see that
          <me>
            \frac{dA}{dt} \Big|_{r=3}=  2\pi (3)(0.5) = 3\pi\approx 9.42\text{ ft } ^2\text{ /sec }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Reflect Back:</em> We have successfully found a value for the quantity <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m> when <m>r=3</m>,
          as asked for in the problem.
          Our units are accurate since <m>A</m> is measured in square feet and <m>t</m> is measured in seconds.
          The positive answer makes sense since the area should be increasing as the radius increases.
          The area is additionally increasing at a larger rate than the radius,
          which also makes sense since the area of a circle of radius <m>r=3</m> is proportional to the square of the radius,
          so should increase more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Critique and Change the Problem:</em>
          Here is an observation that goes beyond what was asked in the problem: Notice that even though the radius of the circle is changing at a constant rate,
          the area of the circle will not be changing at a constant rate.
          As the radius gets larger, the change in the area will increase.
          When the radius is <m>r=5</m>,
          the change in the area will be
          <me>
            \frac{dA}{dt}\Big|_{r=5} = 2\pi(5)(0.5) = 5\pi\approx 15.7\text{ ft } ^2\text{ /sec }
          </me>.
          When the radius is <m>r=10</m>,
          the change in the area will be
          <me>
            \frac{dA}{dt}\Big|_{r=10} = 2\pi(10)(0.5) = 10\pi\approx 31.4\text{ ft } ^2\text{ /sec }
          </me>.
          When the radius of is <m>r=20</m> feet,
          the change in the area will be
          <me>
            \frac{dA}{dt}\Big|_{r=20} = 2\pi(20)(0.5) = 20\pi\approx 62.8\text{ ft } ^2\text{ /sec }
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Most related-rates problems involve two rates,
      one of which is known and one of which you are asked to find.
      These rates will be related in some way that is determined by the way the corresponding quantities are related.
      Translating a related-rates problem from words to equations should result in an equation that relates the two quantities whose derivatives you either know or want to find.
      You can then implicitly differentiate the equation relating the quantities to get an equation relating the derivatives,
      as we did in the previous example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next two exercises practice the computational steps of solving a related rates problem:
      taking the derivative and plugging in numbers.
      Once we have an equation relating the two quantities, we take the derivative:
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="ex_relatingrates">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that the lengths <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> of the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse of length 7 inches are changing over time.
          Using implicit differentiation,
          obtain a relationship between the rates of change of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
          In other words,
          take <m>\frac{d}{dt}</m> of the equation from Example <xref ref="ex_legsoftriangle" autoname="yes"/>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Finishing a related rates problem involves using quantities and rates of change given in the problem to solve for the rate of change you wish to know.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that the leg of length <m>a</m> in Example <xref ref="ex_legsoftriangle" autoname="yes"/> is growing at a rate of <m>0.2</m> inches per second.
          How is the length of leg <m>b</m> changing at the moment when leg <m>a</m> is <m>6</m> inches and <m>b</m> is <m>\sqrt{13}</m> inches?
          In other words, given <m>\frac{da}{dt}=0.2</m>,
          find <m>\frac{db}{dt}</m> when <m>a=6</m> and <m>b = \sqrt{13}</m>,
          using the equation relating <m>\frac{da}{dt}</m> and
          <m>\frac{db}{dt}</m> from <xref ref="ex_relatingrates">Exercise</xref>.
          <em>Include units in your answer!</em><fn>
          If we were only told that <m>a=6</m>,
          we could find <m>b=\sqrt{13}</m> by using the original equation:
          <m>a^2+b^2=7^2</m> and solving for <m>b</m>.
          </fn>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Here is another example of a Related Rates problem.
      Again, notice the structure of the problem:
      quantities that are changing over time are described,
      and we are given one of their rates of change.
      We are asked to find the rate of change of the other quantity.
      After finding an equation relating the quantities,
      we take the derivative via implicit differentiation,
      plug in the numbers we are given,
      and solve for the desired quantity.

          The circumference of a circular shadow is increasing at a rate of 3 inches per minute.
          At what rate is the area of the shadow changing when the circumference is 16 inches?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <em>Meet the Problem:</em> The quantities involved in the problem are the circumference,
          <m>C</m>,
          and area, <m>A</m>, of a circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="28%" source="CircAndArea.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          We are told that the circumference is increasing at a rate of 3 inches per minute,
          so if we let <m>t</m> represent time in minutes,
          we can write <m>\frac{dC}{dt} =3</m>.
          We are asked to find the rate at which the area of the shadow is changing,
          so we would like to find <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m>.
          Specifically,
          we want to find <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m> when <m>C=16</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Make a Plan:</em> It is not entirely obvious how to get an equation involving the circumference <m>C</m> and area <m>A</m> of a circle.
          Since the area and radius are related,
          and the radius and circumference are related,
          we may reasonably expect the area and the circumference to be related.
          That means we should be able to find an equation containing both <m>A</m> and <m>C</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The area and radius are related via
          <me>
            A=\pi r^2
          </me>
          while the circumference and radius are related via
          <me>
            C=2\pi r
          </me>.
          We can find an equation involving only <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> by solving one equation for <m>r</m> and substituting it into the other equation,
          eliminating the variable <m>r</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we have that equation,
          we take its derivative and plug in the information that we are given:
          <m>C=16</m> and <m>\frac{dC}{dt}=3</m>,
          then solve for <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Carry out Your Plan:</em> The equation
          <m>C=2\pi r</m> is easier to solve for <m>r</m>,
          so we solve for <m>r</m> in terms of <m>C</m> and substitute into <m>A=\pi r^2</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}C \amp =2 \pi r\\ \frac{C}{2\pi} \amp = r \end{aligned}
          </me>
          and so
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}A \amp = \pi r^2\\ A \amp =\pi \left(\frac{C}{2\pi}\right)^2\\ A \amp = \frac{C^2}{4\pi} \end{aligned}
          </me>
          where we have simplified and cancelled one of the <m>\pi</m>'s in the last step.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we see that, yes indeed,
          the area and circumference of a circle are related,
          specifically by the equation
          <me>
            A=\frac{C^2}{4\pi}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We take the derivative <m>\frac{d}{dt}</m> of both sides.
          Note that we do not actually need to use the quotient rule because <m>4\pi</m> is a constant,
          so we rewrite the equation first to make this more obvious:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{dA}{dt} \amp = \frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{1}{4\pi} \cdot C^2\right]\\ \amp = \frac{1}{4\pi}\cdot 2C\, \frac{dC}{dt}\\ \amp = \frac{C}{2\pi}\,\frac{dC}{dt} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Plugging in <m>C=16</m> and <m>\frac{dC}{dt}=3</m>, we have
          <me>
            \frac{dA}{dt}\Big|_{C=16} = \frac{16}{2\pi}\cdot 3 = \frac{24}{\pi}\approx 7.6394 \text{ ft } ^2/\text{ min }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Reflect Back:</em> We can check that our answer makes sense in context.
          In particular,
          the area is increasing since the derivative is positive,
          which it should since the circle is getting larger.
          The units are correct since area is measured in ft<m>^2</m> while time is measured in feet.
          We can even notice that the area is increasing faster than the circumference,
          which makes sense since area is proportional to the square of the circumference in the original equation we had.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Critique and Change the Problem:</em>
          Here we could think about ways to change the problem.
          For instance,
          what if we were given the rate of change of the area and were asked to find the rate of change of the circumference?
          Our work would be mostly the same,
          except for the final step when we plug in and solve.
          If we are additionally given the value of the area instead of the circumference,
          we would have to do a bit more work.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example:
          what if we are told that the area is decreasing by 2 ft<m>^2</m>/min and are asked to find the rate at which the circumference decreases when the area is 9 ft<m>^2</m>?
          Then we can plug in <m>\frac{dA}{dt}=-2</m> but we would still need a value of <m>C</m> in order to solve for <m>\frac{dC}{dt}</m> in
          <me>
            \frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{C}{2\pi}\,\frac{dC}{dt}
          </me>.
          Since we are told that <m>A=9</m>,
          we can use the original equation
          <m>A=\frac{C^2}{4\pi}</m> to find the value of <m>C</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}9 \amp =\frac{C^2}{4\pi}\\ 36\pi \amp = C^2\\ \pm\sqrt{36\pi} \amp = C\\ \pm6\sqrt{\pi} \amp = C \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Circumference is a length and should be positive,
          so <m>C = 6\sqrt{\pi}\approx 10.6347</m>.
          Now we can plug in and solve for <m>\frac{dC}{dt}</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{dA}{dt} \amp = \frac{C}{2\pi}\,\frac{dC}{dt}\\ -2 \amp = \frac{6\sqrt{\pi}}{4\pi}\,\frac{dC}{dt}\\ -2\cdot \frac{4\pi}{6\sqrt{\pi}} \amp =\frac{dC}{dt}\\ -\frac{4\pi}{3\sqrt{\pi}} \amp =\frac{dC}{dt} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          And so the circumference is decreasing by <m>\frac{4\pi}{3\sqrt{\pi}}\approx 2.3633</m> ft/min.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <title>How to Solve Related Rates Problems</title>
    <p>
      Related rates problems are complicated enough that it's extremely useful to have a step-by-step method to follow in order to solve them.
      We summarize the main approach for these problems here,
      incorporating the specific steps for related rates problems within the general problem solving framework:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)</em>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Read the problem at least once before writing anything.

      Consider critiquing or changing the problem when working on homework as this will help you to be able to solve similar,

      <p>
        When identifying variables and drawing a picture,
        it is important to think about the dynamic ways in which the quantities change.
        Sometimes a sequence of pictures can be helpful.
        In general, quantities that change should be given variable names,
        labeled in the picture.
        Quantities that are constant should not be given extra letter names
        (to avoid confusion)
        and should be labeled with numbers in the picture.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      The following example demonstrates this method applied to two different questions involving the same situation of an inflating party balloon.
      As you read it, think about the structure of the solution.
      Which part of the framework is being applied at a given time?
      It is left to the reader to reflect on the suitability of the answers and whether such a problem is realistic or how it could be changed.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose a pink spherical party balloon is being inflated at a constant rate of 44 cubic inches per second.
          <ol marker="labelalphitemsep10pt">
            <li>
              <p>

            <li>
              <p>
                How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing at the instant that the balloon contains 100 cubic inches of air?

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          In this problem,
          the two quantities that are changing are the radius of the balloon,
          which we'll call <m>r</m>,
          and the volume of the balloon,
          which we'll call <m>V</m>.
          Below is a picture of the spherical balloon with the radius marked with the variable <m>r</m>,
          along with the value of the radius, <m>r=4</m>,
          specified in part (a) of the problem.

            Note that <m>r</m> is <em>not always</em> equal to 4.
            We are interested in the <em>single moment of time</em> when it is 4
            (for part a).

          We are told that the balloon is "being inflated at a constant rate of 44 cubic inches per second," which translates to <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 44</m>.
          We wish to find "how fast the radius of the balloon is increasing," which translates to wanting to find <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.

          An equation relating the volume and radius of a sphere is
          <me>
            V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to <m>t</m> (using implicit differentiation):
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dt}[V] \amp = \frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\right]\\ \frac{dV}{dt} \amp = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(3r^2\,\frac{dr}{dt}\right)\\ \frac{dV}{dt} \amp = 4\pi r^2\,\frac{dr}{dt} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we wish to find <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>, let's solve for it.
          This isn't absolutely necessary,
          but it will make what follows easier to understand:
          <me>
            \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dV/dt}{4\pi r^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Part (a):</em> We wish to find
          <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m> at the "instant that the balloon has a radius of 4 inches," meaning when <m>r=4</m>.
          Since we also know <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 44</m>,
          we can just plug these in:
          <me>
            \frac{dr}{dt}\Big|_{r=4} = \frac{44}{4\pi (4)^2} \approx 0.2188 \text{ inches per second }
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Part (b):</em> We wish to find
          <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m> at the "instant that the balloon contains 100 cubic inches of air," meaning when <m>V=100</m>.
          This we cannot just plug in,
          since we need to know the value of <m>r</m> for this value of <m>V</m>.
          Hence we use the original equation
          <m>V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</m> to find the corresponding <m>r</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}100\amp  = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\\ \frac{100}{(4/3)\pi} \amp = r^3\\ \left(\frac{100}{(4/3)\pi}\right)^{1/3} \amp =r\\ 2.879 \approx r \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can solve for <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>,
          remembering that <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 44</m>:
          <me>
            \frac{dr}{dt}\Big|_{V=100} = \frac{dr}{dt}\Big|_{r\approx 2.879} = \frac{44}{4\pi(2.879)}\approx 0.422\text{ inches per second }
          </me>

          Boyle's Law states that when a sample of gas is compressed at a constant temperature,
          the pressure <m>P</m> and volume <m>V</m> satisfy the equation <m>PV=C</m>,
          where <m>C</m> is a constant.
          At a certain instant the volume of a gas is 600 cm<m>^3</m> and the pressure is 150 kPa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that the pressure is increasing at a rate of 20 kPa/min.
          At what rate is the volume decreasing at the instant when the volume of the gas is 600 cm<m>^3</m> and the pressure is 150 kPa?

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> If two quantities are related,
      then their rates of change are also related.
      We can take the derivative of an equation relating the quantities in order to find the relationship between the rates of change.
      Such "related rates problems" have a predictable format that you should learn to recognize in order to not get lost while solving these types of problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      A derivative is a rate of change.
      Units are extremely useful for identifying the meaning of a given number in the context of a word problem.
      Word problem should be read at least three times while completing the problem,
      twice at the beginning and once again at the end.
