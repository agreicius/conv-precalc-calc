    <title>Percentage Growth</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we explore in more depth several concrete applications where exponential functions are used to model real-world phenomena.
      The first of these was introduced in <xref ref="sec_expfunctions">Section</xref>.
      If a quantity changes by a fixed percentage over repeated periods of the same duration,
      then that quantity will be an exponential function of time.

          For example,
          what if you start with 8 pounds of potatoes on day zero and then increase the number of pounds by 50 percent each subsequent day?
          Starting with 8 pounds, on day one you add 4 more pounds,
          for a total of 12 pounds.
          On day two you add 6 more pounds, for a total of 18 pounds.
          On day three you add 9 pounds,
          for a total of 27 pounds, and so on, as shown below

      <statement>
        <p>
          As another example,
          consider a savings account with an initial balance of $1000.00 that earns 3% interest each month.
          Let <m>B(t)</m> represent the balance of the savings account <m>t</m> months after the initial deposit.
          After one month, the amount in the savings account will be
          <me>
            B(1) = 1000+0.03(1000) = \dollar1030.00
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>1000+0.03 = 1.03(1000)</m>,
          we could also write this equation as:
          <me>
            B(1) = 1000(1.03) = \dollar1030.00
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the balance after two months,
          we need to multiply <m>B(1)</m> by <m>1.03</m>
          (since the balance should grow by 3 percent more).
          The balance of the savings account after two months will be <m>B(1)(1.03) = (1000(1.03))(1.03) = 1000(1.03)^2</m>:
          <me>
            B(2) = 100(1.03)^2 = \dollar1060.90
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, after three months the savings account balance will be
          <me>
            B(3) = 1000(1.03)^3 = \dollar1092.73
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each month the balance in the savings account will be <m>1.03</m> times the amount in the savings account the previous month.
          The savings account balance <m>B(t)</m> after <m>t</m> months is the function <m>B(t) = 1000(1.03)(1.03)\dots(1.03)(1.03)</m>,
          with <m>t</m> copies of <m>1.03</m>.
          This is an exponential function:
          <me>
            B(t) = 1000(1.03)^t
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      In general, if a quantity <m>Q(t)</m> increases by a fixed percentage <m>r</m> each period of a given duration,
      where <m>t</m> is measured in terms of that period and <m>r</m> is written in decimal form,
      then <m>Q(t)</m> is an exponential function with base <m>1+r</m> and exponent <m>t</m> and with coefficient given by the initial amount <m>Q_0</m> of the quantity.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Percentage Growth Formula</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>Q(t)</m> with an initial quantity of
          <m>Q(0)=Q_0</m> grows at a fixed decimal percentage <m>r</m> over every period <m>t</m>,
          then <m>Q(t)</m> is modeled by the exponential function
          <me>
            Q(t) = Q_0(1+r)^t
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The decimal percentage <m>r</m> is what we have called the <em>growth rate</em>
      and the base <m>b=1+r</m> is what we have called the <em>growth factor</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This formula works for any real value of <m>t</m>,
      not just for integer values.
      For example, in the context of the savings balance problem,
      this formula says that you will have
      <m>B(3.5) = 1000(1.03)^{3.5}\approx \dollar1109.00</m> in your savings account after three-and-a-half months.
      However, in real life your savings account balance might grow only at the beginning of each month,
      and thus <m>B(3.5)</m> in real life would be the same as <m>B(3)</m>.
      <em>The percentage growth formula is a continuous model for what in real life might be a discrete phenomenon.</em>

      <statement>
        <p>
          A termite colony is slowly dying off.
          Three weeks ago, there were 2500 termites in the colony;
          now there are only 1250.
          Assuming that the population of termites is decreasing by a fixed percentage each week,
          let's determine when there will be only 300 termites in the colony.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(t)</m> be the population of termites after <m>t</m> weeks,
          where <m>t=0</m> represents three weeks ago.
          Then <m>P_0=P(0)=2500</m>, and <m>P(3)=1250</m>.
          Since the population of termites decreases by a fixed percentage each week,
          <m>P(t)</m> is an exponential function and we can write
          <me>
            P(t)=2500 b^t
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>P(0)=2500</m> already told us the coefficient,
          so we use the other value <m>P(3)=1250</m> to solve for <m>b</m>.
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}P(3)=\amp 1250 \\ 2500b^3=\amp 1250\\ b^3=\amp \frac{1}{2}\\ b=\amp \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1/3} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>b=(1/2)^{1/3}\approx 0.7937</m> and we model the population via
          <me>
            P(t) = 25000(0.7937)^t
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we can solve for the time <m>t</m> at which there are only 300 termites left in the colony by solving the equation <m>P(t)=300</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}P(t)=\amp 300 \\ 2500(0.7937)^t=\amp 300\\ (0.7937)^t=\amp \frac{300}{2500}\\ (0.7937)^t=\amp 0.12\\ \log_{10}((0.7937)^t)=\amp \log_{10}\left(0.12\right)\\ t\log_{10}(0.7937)=\amp \log_{10}\left(0.12\right)\\ t=\amp \frac{\log_{10}\left(0.12\right)}{\log_{10}(0.7937)} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that in the 5th line, we applied <m>\log_{10}</m> to both sides.
          The choice of base was arbitrary;
          we just needed a logarithm to be able to move the <m>t</m> out of the exponent.
          By using the Change of Base formula,
          we could convert this fraction to any other base logarithm we wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, we found that <m>t=\frac{\log_{10}\left(0.12\right)}{\log_{10}(0.7937)}\approx9.17665</m>.
          This means that there will be 300 termites in the colony just after nine weeks from <m>t=0</m>,
          and therefore just after 6 weeks from the time that was considered to be
          <q>now</q>
          in the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Note that we never determined by what percent the colony was decreasing.
          <m>b=0.7937</m> was the growth factor, not the growth rate.
          Using the relationship <m>b=1+r</m>,
          we can determine that <m>r=0.7937-1=-0.2063</m>,
          meaning that the population of termites must be decreasing by about 20.6% a week.</em>

    <title>Doubling Time and Half-Life</title>
    <p>
      All exponential functions increase or decrease by a fixed percentage over each unit of the independent variable.
      But there is no reason to consider the percent increase or decrease over only one unit.
      Instead, let's consider the question of how long it takes for a function to increase or decrease by a fixed percentage and how long that will take.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance,
      we could ask how long it would take a quantity to double,
      meaning to increase by 100%.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_introdoubling">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we have a population of 100 cells in a petri dish that increase by 16% every hour.
          How long will it take the population to double?
          The size of the population can be modeled by the equation
          <me>
            P(t) = 100(1.16)^t
          </me>
          and we wish to know when there are 200 cells.
          Thus we can find the amount of time <m>t</m> by solving via logarithms:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}100(1.16)^t \amp = 200\\ (1.16)^t \amp = \frac{200}{100} = 2\\ \log_{10}(1.16)^t \amp = \log_{10}(2)\\ t\log_{10}(1.16) \amp = \log_{10}2\\ t \amp = \frac{\log_{10}2}{\log_{10}(1.16)}\approx 4.67 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it takes about 4.67 hours for the population of cells to double,
          mean to increase by 100%.
        </p>
        <p>
          How long will it take the same cells to double again,
          meaning to increase from 200 to 400?
          Starting with 200 cells, we have
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}200(1.16)^t \amp = 400\\ (1.16)^t \amp = \frac{400}{200} = 2\\ \log_{10}(1.16)^t \amp = \log_{10}(2)\\ t\log_{10}(1.16) \amp = \log_{10}2\\ t \amp = \frac{\log_{10}2}{\log_{10}(1.16)}\approx 4.67 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it will take an additional 4.67 hours for the cells to increase from 200 to 400.
        </p>
        <p>
          How long will it take the same cells to double again,
          meaning to increase from 400 to 800?
          Starting with 400 cells, we have
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}400(1.16)^t \amp = 800\\ (1.16)^t \amp = \frac{800}{400} = 2\\ \log_{10}(1.16)^t \amp = \log_{10}(2)\\ t\log_{10}(1.16) \amp = \log_{10}2\\ t \amp = \frac{\log_{10}2}{\log_{10}(1.16)}\approx 4.67 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it will take an additional 4.67 hours for the cells to increase from 400 to 800.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that all of the calculations above become the same after dividing by the number of cells we started with.
          In general, if we start with an initial population of <m>P_0</m> cells that grow 16% each hour,
          we can determine how long it will take for the population will double,
          meaning when we will have <m>2P_0</m> cells:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}P_0(1.16)^t \amp = 2P_0\\ (1.16)^t \amp = \frac{2P_0}{P_0} = 2\\ \log_{10}(1.16)^t \amp = \log_{10}(2)\\ t\log_{10}(1.16) \amp = \log_{10}2\\ t \amp = \frac{\log_{10}2}{\log_{10}(1.16)}\approx 4.67 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it will take an additional 4.67 hours for the cells to increase from any initial population <m>P_0</m> to <m>2P_0</m>,
          meaning it will take the cells about 4.67 hours to double no matter how many cells we start with.

    <p>
      What we saw in <xref ref="ex_introdoubling">Example</xref>
      is that it takes a fixed length of time for an exponential function to double.
      This length of time is what is called the
      <em>doubling time</em> of the function.
      We can confirm this by observing that all exponential functions can be rewritten in the form
      <me>
        f(t) = A2^{kt}
      </me>
      where <m>k</m> is some nonzero number.
      Then, when the exponent <m>kt</m> increases by 1, the function <m>f(t)</m> is multiplied by 2, meaning it doubles.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(t) = 3^t</m> can be rewritten as
          <me>
            f(t) = 3^t = 2^{(\log_2 3) t}\approx 2^{1.585 t}
          </me>
          since
          <me>
            2^{(\log_2 3) t} = (2^{\log_2 3})^t = (3)^t
          </me>
          by the cancellation properties of logarithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the function <m>g(t) = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^t</m> can be rewritten as
          <me>
            g(t) = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^t= 2^{(\log_2 (1/3)) t}\approx 2^{-1.585 t}
          </me>,
          using the same property that <m>2^{(\log_2 (1/3)) t} = (2^{\log_2 (1/3)})^t = (1/3)^t</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Notice in the above example that <m>k</m> can be either positive or negative.
      We can always convert from base <m>b</m> to base <m>2</m> via
      <me>
        b^t = 2^{(\log_2 b)t}
      </me>
      and so we have
      <me>
        k = \log_2 b
      </me>.
      If we graph <m>y=\log_2x</m>,
      we can see that for <m>b>1</m>, <m>k = \log_2 b>0</m>.
      Thus when an exponential function models exponential growth,
      <m>k</m> is positive.
      For <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m>, <m>k = \log_2 b\lt 0</m>.
      Thus when an exponential function models exponential decay,
      <m>k</m> is negative.

      For an exponential function that models decay,
      it does not make sense to talk about doubling time since the values of the function are decreasing;
      we would have to move "backward" in time for the values of the function to double.
      Instead, exponential decay uses the idea of <em>half-life</em>,
      meaning the amount of time for the values of the function to decrease by 50%.

          is a method for determining the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radiocarbon,
          a radioactive isotope of carbon.
          The method was developed in the late 1940s at the University of Chicago by Willard Libby.<fn>

          Carbon-14 decays very slowly:
          about 0.0121% per year.
          What is the half-life of carbon-14, meaning:
          how long will it take for an amount of carbon-14 to decay to half of its current mass?
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>C_0</m> is the initial amount of carbon-14.
          The amount of carbon-14 after <m>t</m> years is then
          <me>
            C(t) = C_0(1-0.000121)^t = C_0(0.9999879)^t
          </me>.
          We wish to find the amount of time it takes for the carbon-14 to reach a mass of <m>\frac{C_0}{2}</m>,
          and so we set <m>C(t) = \frac{C_0}{2}</m> and solve for <m>t</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}C_0(0.9999879)^t \amp = \frac{C_0}{2}\\ (0.9999879)^t \amp = \frac{C_0}{2C_0} = \frac{1}{2}\\ \log_{10}(0.9999879)^t \amp = \log_{10}\left( \frac{1}{2}\right)\\ t\log_{10}(0.9999879) \amp = \log_{10}\left( \frac{1}{2}\right)\\ t \amp =\frac{ \log_{10}\left( 1/2\right)}{\log_{10}(0.9999879)}\approx 57284.5 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it takes about 57284.5 years for the amount of carbon-14 to reduce by half,
          meaning that it has a half-life of 57284.5.

        <p>
          What is the quarter-life of carbon-14,
          meaning how long will it take for an amount of carbon-14 to become <m>1/4</m> of its original amount?

      What we saw in <xref ref="ex_introhalflife">Example</xref>
      is that it takes a fixed length of time for an exponential function to halve,
      meaning decrease by 50%. This length of time is what is called the
      <em>half-life</em> of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use measures of doubling time and half-life to determine models for processes modeled by exponential functions,
      and use those models to predict the behavior of those processes.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose a population of bacteria is growing in a petri dish in such a way that the number of bacteria doubles every 3 hours.
          If there are initially 1000 bacteria in the petri dish,
          how long will it take for there to be 1 million bacteria?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>B(t)</m> be the number of bacteria in the dish after <m>t</m> hours.
          Since <m>B(t)</m> has a constant doubling time,
          we will model it with an exponential function of the form
          <m>B(t) = B_02^{kt}</m> for some values <m>B_0</m> and <m>k</m>.
          Moreover, we know that <m>B(0) = 1000</m>,
          therefore <m>B(t) = 1000(2)^{kt}</m>.
          Since the bacteria population doubles every three hours,
          <m>B(3) = 2B(0) = 2(1000) = 2000</m>.
          We can use this fact to solve for <m>k</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}B(3) \amp = 2000\\ 1000(2)^{3k} \amp = 2000\\ 2^{3k} \amp = 2\\ 3k \amp = 1\\ k \amp = \frac{1}{3} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This fits the information we are given:
          if <m>t</m> is measured in hours,
          it takes 3 hours for the exponent
          <m>\frac{1}{3}t</m> to increase one hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we know the number of bacteria in the petri dish after <m>t</m> hours is given by
          <me>
            B(t) = 1000(2)^{t/3}
          </me>
          and we can find out when there will be 1 million bacteria by solving the equation <m>B(t)= 1,000,000</m> for <m>t</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}B(t) \amp = 1,000,000\\ 1000(2)^{t/3} \amp = 1,000,000\\ 2^{t/3} \amp = 1000\\ \frac{t}{3} \amp = \log_2(1000)\\ t \amp = 3\log_2(1000)\approx 29.9 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore it will be approximately 29.9 hours before there are 1 million bacteria in the petri dish.
        </p>

        This kind of calculation is extremely useful if you are working with cells trying to plan how long you need to wait for your sample to reach a particular size before running an assay that requires a certain number of cells,
        or if you want to split your sample for use in multiple experiments.
        In fact, the author has helped her biologist husband with such calculations in the past.
        His coworkers were impressed.

      It is possible to determine the doubling time/half-life of a quantity if given the percent growth rate,
      and vice versa.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Radioactive substances have constant half-lives.
          This means that the quantity of a radioactive substance always takes the same amount of time to decrease by half,
          no matter how much or how little of the substance that you start with.
          For example - suppose that the half-life of the fictional substance unobtainium is 29 years.
          A sample of rock is found with 80 grams of unobtainium.
          Let's compute the percentage by which the amount of unobtainium in the rock decreases each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>S(t)</m> represent the number of grams of unobtainium that are left after <m>t</m> years.
          Since <m>S(t)</m> has a constant half-life,
          we will model <m>S(t)</m> with an exponential function.
          We also know that the initial value is <m>S_0=S(0)=80</m> grams.
          Therefore, <m>S(t)=80(b^{t})</m> for some <m>b</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start by using the given half-life to solve for the value of the growth factor <m>b</m>.
          Since unobtainium has a half-life,
          and we start with 80 grams of it,
          we know that <m>S(29)=\frac{S_0}{2}=40</m> grams.
          We use this fact to solve for <m>b</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}S(29)=\amp 40 \\ 80(b^{29})=\amp 40\\ b^{29}=\amp \frac{1}{2}\\ b \amp = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1/29}\\ b \amp = 2^{-1/29} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that the number of grams of unobtainium in the rock after <m>t</m> years is given by the exponential function <m>S(t)=80(2^{-1/29})^t) = 80(2^{-t/29})</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the percent decrease, we find the growth rate
          <me>
            r = b-1 = 2^{-1/29}-1\approx -0.02362
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the amount of unobtainium in the rock decreases by approximately 2.362% each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          To double check the answer we just found,
          we can verify that decreasing the original amount of 80 grams by 2.362% per year for 29 years will bring us down to half the initial amount, 40 grams.
          Indeed, we have
          <me>
            S(29)=80(1-0.02362)^{29}\approx 39.9979
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only reason we don't get exactly 40 grams is because we did some rounding when computing the decimal value of <m>r=2^{-1/29}-1</m>.

    <title>Modeling Temperature Data</title>
    <p>
      If a quantity changes so that its growth or decay occurs at a constant percentage rate with respect to time,
      the function is exponential.
      Likewise, if a quantity doubles or halves over a constant time period,
      the function is exponential.
    </p>
    <p>
      A related situation arises when an object's temperature changes in response to its surroundings.
      For instance,
      if we have a cup of coffee at an initial temperature of 186 degrees Fahrenheit and the cup is placed in a room where the surrounding temperature is 71 degrees Fahrenheit,
      our intuition and experience tell us that over time the coffee will cool and eventually tend to the 71 degree Fahrenheit temperature of the surroundings.
      From an experiment with an actual temperature probe,
      we have the data in in the following table,
      that is plotted in the adjacent figure.

      In one sense, the data looks exponential:
      the points appear to lie on a curve that is always decreasing and decreasing at an increasing rate.
      However, we know that the function can't have the form
      <m>f(t)=ab^t</m>,because such a function's range is the set of all positive real numbers,
      and it's impossible for the coffee's temperature to fall below room temperature (71 degrees).
      It is natural to wonder if a function of the form <m>g(t)=ab^t+c</m> will work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function <m>g(t)=ab^t+c</m> is a vertical translation of the function <m>f(t)=ab^t</m>.
      We now have extensive understanding of the behavior of <m>f(t)</m>,
      and how that behavior depends on <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      Since a vertical translation by <m>c</m> does not change the shape of any graph,
      we expect that <m>g</m> will exhibit very similar behavior to <m>f</m>, Indeed,
      we can compare the two functions' graphs,
      as shown in the following figures.

      Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate that an object warms or cools occurs in direct proportion to the difference between its own temperature and the temperature of its surroundings.
      If we return to the coffee temperature data in <xref ref="tab_temp">Table</xref>
      and recall that the room temperature in that experiment was <m>71</m> degrees Fahrenheit,
      we can see how to use a transformed exponential function to model the data.
      In <xref ref="tab_tempshifted">Table</xref>,
      we add a row of information to the table where we compute <m>F(t)-71</m> to subtract the room temperature from each reading.

      The data in the bottom row of <xref ref="tab_tempshifted">Table</xref> appears exponential,
      and if we test the data by computing the quotients of output values that correspond to equally-spaced input,
      we see a nearly constant ratio.
      In particular,
      <me>
        \frac{73}{85}\approx0.86, \ \ \frac{64}{73}\approx0.88, \ \ \frac{56}{64}\approx0.88, \ \ \frac{49}{56}\approx0.88, \ \ \frac{45}{49}\approx0.92,  \textrm{ and } \frac{40}{55}\approx0.89

      Of course, there is some measurement error in the data

      In addition,
      we expect that if the data continued in the bottom row of <xref ref="tab_tempshifted">Table</xref>,

      and assume that <m>f(t)=ab^t</m>,
      we can determine the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      Doing so, it turns out that
      <m>a\approx103,503</m> and <m>b\approx0.974</m>,
      so that <m>f(t)=103.503(0.974)^t</m>.
      Since <m>f(t)=F(t)-71</m>,
      we can see that <m>F(t)=f(t)+71=103.503(0.974)^t+71</m>.
      Plotting <m>f</m> against the shifted data and <m>F</m> along with the original data in <xref ref="fig_temp">Figure</xref>
      and <xref ref="fig_tempshifted">Figure</xref>,
      we see that the curves go exactly through the points where <m>t=18</m> and <m>t=23</m> as expected,
      but also that the function provides a reasonable model for the observed behavior at any time <m>t</m>.
      If our data was even more accurate,
      we would expect that the curve's fit would be even better.

      Our preceding work with the coffee data can be done similarly with data for any cooling or warming object whose temperature initially differs from its surroundings.
      Indeed, it is possible to show that Newton's Law of Cooling implies that the object's temperature is given by a function of the form <m>F(t)=ab^t+c</m>.

    <title>Measuring Earthquakes and Sound</title>
    <p>
      Logarithmic functions are also used to model real-world phenomena.
      One of the most commonly used such models is the Richter magnitude scale
      (often shortened to Richter scale),
      used to rate the magnitude of an earthquake,
      that is the amount of energy released during an earthquake.Another model is the unit of measurement called a decibel,
      which is used to measure sound.<fn>

      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at the <em>Richter scale</em>,
      a logarithmic function that is used to measure the magnitude of earthquakes.
      The magnitude of an earthquake is related to how much energy is released by the quake.
      Instruments called seismographs detect movement in the earth.
      If the smallest movement that can be detected shows on a seismograph as a wave with amplitude <m>A_0</m>,
      and we let <m>A</m> be the measure of the amplitude of an earthquake wave, then
      <me>
        R=\log_{10}\left(\frac{A}{A_0}\right)
      </me>
      is the Richter scale measure of the magnitude of the earthquake.
      Note that this formula makes use of the relative size of the amplitude <m>A</m> of the earthquake being measured to the amplitude of the smallest detectable wave,
      called a <em>standard wave</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the logarithm rules,
      we can rewrite the formula for the Richter scale as
      <me>
        R = \log_{10}A-\log_{10}A_0
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>A_0</m> is some fixed number
      (depending on the seismograph being used),
      <m>\log_{10}A_0</m> is also a fixed number.
      Thus the increase in the Richter scale depends only on the term
      <m>\log_{10}A</m> and we see that the Richter scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale,
      meaning that each order of magnitude is 10 times more intensive than the last one.
      In other words,
      a two is 10 times more intense than a one and a three is 100 times greater.
      In the case of the Richter scale,
      the increase is in wave amplitude.
      That is, the wave amplitude in a level 6 earthquake is 10 times greater than in a level 5 earthquake,
      and the amplitude increases 100 times between a level 7 earthquake and a level 9 earthquake.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An earthquake is measured with a wave amplitude 392 times as great as <m>A_0</m>.
          What is the magnitude of this earthquake using the Richter scale,
          to the nearest tenth?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since <m>A</m> is 392 times as large as <m>A_0</m>, <m>A = 392A_0</m>.
          Substituting this expression in for <m>A</m>:
          <me>
            R=\log_{10}\left(\frac{392A_0}{A_0}\right) = \log_{10}(392)\approx 2.6
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      A difference of 1 point on the Richter scale equates to a 10-fold difference in the amplitude of the earthquake
      (which is related to the wave strength).
      This means that an earthquake that measures 3.6 on the Richter scale has 10 times the amplitude of one that measures 2.6.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's look back at the previous example.
          In that example,
          the wave amplitude of the earthquake was 392 times normal.
          What if it were 10 times that, or 3,920 times normal?
          To find the measurement of that size earthquake on the Richter scale, you find
          <me>
            R = \log_{10}\left(\frac{ 3920A_0}{A_0}\right) = \log_{10}(3920)\approx 3.6
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus one point on the Richter scale corresponds to a much,
          much more intense earthquake!
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The Richter scale is particularly useful in allowing us to measure the magnitude of earthquakes relative to each other.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An earthquake on July 30, 2018 in California measured 3.7 on the Richter scale.
          If an earthquake is 16,550 times more powerful than the California earthquake,
          what would be its magnitude on the Richter scale?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Suppose that the California earthquake had maximum wave amplitude of <m>C</m>.
          Then the Richter scale magnitude of the California earthquake tells us that
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}3.7 \amp = \log_{10}\left(\frac{C}{A_0}\right)\\ \amp = \log_{10}C - \log_{10}A_0 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The magnitude <m>A</m> of the earthquake we wish to measure is 16,550 times more powerful,
          meaning that
          <me>
            A = 16550C
          </me>.
          Substituting this into the Richter scale measurement for <m>A</m>,
          we are able to expand via the logarithm rules:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}R \amp = \log_{10}\left(\frac{A}{A_0}\right) \\ \amp =\log_{10}\left(\frac{16550C}{A_0}\right)\\ \amp = \log_{10}(16550)+\log_{10}C-\log_{10}A_0 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          However we already know that
          <m>\log_{10}C-\log_{10}A_0=3.7</m>, so in measuring <m>R</m>,
          we need only add <m>\log_{10}(16550)</m> to the previous measurement of 3.7:
          <me>
            R = \log_{10}(16550)+3.7\approx 4.2+3.7 = 7.9
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      In general, in order to determine the Richter scale magnitude of an earthquake that is <m>m</m> times more powerful than an earthquake with Richter scale measurement <m>R_0</m>,
      we must simply add <m>\log_{10}m</m>:
      <me>
        R = \log_{10}m+R_0
      </me>.
    </p>

        <p>
          On March 22, 2011, an earthquake in Japan measured a 9.1 on the Richter scale.
          What is the Richter scale magnitude of an earthquake that is 100,000 times <em>weaker</em>
          than the Japan earthquake?
          <em>This means that <m>A=J/100000</m>,
          where <m>A</m> is the maximum wave amplitude of the earthquake we wish to measure and <m>J</m> is the maximum wave amplitude of the earthquake in Japan.</em>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      The formula for <em>decibels</em>
      looks very similar to the Richter scale:
      <me>
        d=10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)
      </me>
      where <m>P</m> is the power or intensity of the sound and <m>P_0</m> is the weakest sound that the human ear can hear.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          One hot water pump has a noise rating of 50 decibels.
          One dishwasher, however, has a noise rating of 62 decibels.
          The dishwasher noise is how many times more intense than the hot water pump noise?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          You can't easily compare the two noises using the formula,
          but you can compare them to <m>P_0</m>.
          Start by finding the intensity of noise for the hot water pump.
          Use <m>H</m> for the intensity of the hot water pump's noise.
          Then
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}50 \amp =10\log_{10}\left(\frac{H}{P_0}\right)\\ 5 \amp = \log_{10}\left(\frac{H}{P_0}\right) \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          And rewriting in terms of exponents:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}10^5 \amp = \frac{H}{P_0}\\ 10^5P_0 \amp = H \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We repeat the same process to find the intensity <m>D</m> of the noise for the dishwasher:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}62 \amp = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{D}{P_0}\right)\\ 6.2 \amp = \log_{10}\left(\frac{D}{P_0}\right)\\ 10^{6.2} \amp = \frac{D}{P_0}\\ 10^{6.2}P_0 \amp = D \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now to compare <m>D</m> to <m>H</m>, we can divide:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{D}{H} \amp = \frac{10^{6.2}P_0}{10^5P_0}\\ \amp = 10^{1.2} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we see that the dishwasher's noise is
          <m>10^{1.2}\approx 15.85</m> times as intense as the hot water pump.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      With decibels,
      every increase of 10 means the sound is 10 times more intense.
      An increase of 20 would be 10 times more intense for the first 10,
      and another 10 times more intense for the second 1 <ndash/>so a sound that is 75 decibels is 100 times more intense than a sound that is 55 decibels!
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>D_1</m> and <m>D_2</m> represent the decibel ratings of sound intensity <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m>,
          respectively.
          Using logarithm rules,
          we can find a simplified formula for the difference between the two ratings <m>D_1</m> and <m>D_2</m> as follows:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}D_1-D_2 \amp = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_1}{P_0}\right)-10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_2}{P_0}\right)\\ \amp = 10(\log_{10}P_1 - \log_{10}P_0) - 10(\log_{10}P_2-\log_{10}P_0)\\ \amp = 10(\log_{10}P_1 - \log_{10}P_2)\\ \amp = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right) \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If a sound's intensity triples,
          how many decibels louder does the sound become?
          In other words, what is <m>D_1-D_2</m> if <m>P_1=3P_2</m>?
          Using the above formula,
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}D_1-D_2  \amp = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)\\ \amp = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{3P_2}{P_2}\right)\\ \amp = 10\log_{10}(3)\\ \amp \approx 4.77 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the sound becomes about 4.77 decibels louder.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    doubling time, half-life; Richter scale, decibel.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Exponential functions model percent growth,
      and thus have constant doubling time
      (in the case of exponential growth)
      or half-life
      (in the case of exponential decay).
      Transformations of exponential functions can be used to model the temperature of an object being heated or cooled.
      Logarithms are used to measure magnitudes of earthquakes and intensities of sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em> Logarithm rules,
      and the relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions.
