    <title>Transformations</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we examine a few specific compositions of functions that give rise to what are called
      <em>transformations</em>.
      Given a function <m>f(x)</m> and constants <m>a, b, c</m>,
      and <m>d</m>,
      we could consider such modifications as <m>f(x+a),
      f(x)+b, f(cx)</m>, and <m>df(x)</m>.
      Each of these transformations changes <m>f(x)</m> graphically and algebraically.
    </p>
    <p>
      What exactly is the result of adding or multiplying,
      and what difference does it make to do so on the inside versus the outside of the function?
      Take a moment to use this Desmos graph

    <p>
      to explore for yourself.
      The original function <m>f(x)</m> is graphed in blue.
      Adjusting each of the sliders for <m>a, b, c</m>,
      and <m>d</m> will generate a new graph <m>g(x)</m> in orange corresponding to the modification <m>f(x+a),
      f(x)+b, f(cx)</m>, and <m>df(x)</m>.
      <em>Note: you will probably need to access the Desmos graph via a computer,
      rather than a tablet or phone,
      in order for the sliders to work correctly.</em>

    <example>
      <title>Vertical Translation</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Transforming <m>f(x)</m> to
          <m>f(x)\pm b</m> adds/subtracts <m>b</m> units to every output of <m>f(x)</m>.
          This means that the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> shifts up or down vertically <m>b</m> units everywhere,
          to become the graph of <m>y=f(x)+b</m> or <m>y=f(x)-b</m>,
          as illustrated by the red and green graphs, respectively,
          shown in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage64a" autoname="yes"/> below.

      <statement>
        <p>
          If we instead add or subtract a constant to the independent variable and transform <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(x\pm a)</m>,
          the graph shifts left or right horizontally by <m>a</m> units,

      <em>Reflections:</em> Note that in Examples <xref ref="ex_vstretch" autoname="yes"/> and <xref ref="ex_hstretch" autoname="yes"/>,
      the values of <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> used were positive.
      What happens if we multiply <m>x</m> or <m>f(x)</m> by a negative number?
      We can answer that question just by looking at what happens when we multiply by <m>-1</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Vertical and Horizontal Reflection</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Changing <m>f(x)</m> to <m>-f(x)</m> transforms all positive outputs into negative outputs,
          and vice versa.
          The graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is then reflected across the <m>x</m>-axis to become the graph of <m>y=-f(x)</m>,
          as shown in the red graph in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage65c" autoname="yes"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we instead multiply the independent variable by <m>-1</m>,
          then we obtain a reflection across the <m>y</m>-axis,
          as shown in the graph graph in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage65c" autoname="yes"/>.
        </p>

        </figure>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Now if we want to transform <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(-2x)</m>,
      for example,
      we can transform <m>f(x)</m> first to <m>f(2x)</m> and then by reflection to <m>f(-2x)</m>.

          Consider the function <m>r</m> given in <xref ref="fig_APCfigure1-8-13" autoname="yes"/> below.
          Describe in words how the function
          <m>m(x) = 2r(x+1)-1</m> is the result of three transformations of <m>r(x)</m>.
          Does the order in which these transformations occur matter?
          Why or why not?

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are three basic transformations involved:
          a vertical shift of 1 unit down,
          a horizontal shift of 1 unit left,
          and a vertical stretch by a factor of 2.
          To understand the order in which these transformations are applied,
          it's essential to remember that a function is a <em>process</em>
          that converts inputs to outputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the algebraic rule for <m>m</m>, <m>m(x) = 2r(x+1)-1</m>.
          In words, this means that given an input <m>x</m> for <m>m</m>,
          we do the following processes in this particular order:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                add 1 to <m>x</m> and then apply the function <m>r</m> to the quantity <m>x+1</m>;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                multiply the output of <m>r(x+1)</m> by 2;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                subtract 1 from the output of <m>2r(x+1)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          These three steps correspond to three basic transformations:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                shift the graph of <m>r</m> to the left by 1 unit;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                stretch the resulting graph vertically by a factor of 2;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                shift the resulting graph vertically by <m>-1</m> units.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see the graphical impact of these algebraic steps by taking them one at a time.
          Note that in each of the following figures,
          we track the point <m>(2,-1)</m> from the original function.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                In <xref ref="fig_APCfigure1-8-14" autoname="yes"/>,
                we see the function that results from a shift of 1 unit left of the function <m>y=r(x)</m> in <xref ref="fig_APCfigure1-8-13" autoname="yes"/>.
                The tracked point first moves left 1 unit to <m>(1,-1)</m>.
                (Each time we take an additional step,
                we will de-emphasize the preceding function by having it appear in lighter color and dashed.)
                <figure xml:id="fig_APCfigure1-8-14">
                  <caption>The function <m>y=r(x+1)</m>.</caption>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Continuing, we now consider the function <m>y=2r(x+1)</m>,
                which results in a vertical stretch away from the <m>x</m>-axis by a factor of 2, as seen in <xref ref="fig_APCfigure1-8-15" autoname="yes"/>.
                The tracked point is stretched vertically by a factor of 2 away from the <m>x</m>-axis to <m>(1,-2)</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                Finally, we arrive at <m>y=2r(x+1)-1</m> by subtracting 1 from the previous graph;
                this of course is a vertical shift of <m>-1</m> units,
                and produces the graph of <m>m</m> shown in red in <xref ref="fig_APCfigure1-8-16" autoname="yes"/>.
                The tracked point is shifted 1 unit down to the point <m>(1,-3)</m>.

          While there are some transformations that can be executed in either order (such as the combination of a horizontal translation and a vertical translation,
          in other situations order matters.
          In this example,
          we have to apply the vertical stretch <em>before</em>
          applying the vertical shift, Algebraically, this is because
          <me>
            2r(x+1)-1\neq 2[r(x+1)-1]
          </me>.
          The quantity <m>2r(x+1)-1</m> multiplies the function <m>r(x+1)</m> by 2 first
          (the stretch)
          and then the vertical shift follows;
          the quantity <m>2[r(x+1)-1]</m> shifts the function <m>r(x+1)</m> down 1 unit first,
          and then executes a vertical stretch by a factor of 2.
          In the latter scenario,
          the point <m>(1,-1)</m> that lies on <m>r(x+1)</m> gets transformed first to <m>(1,-2)</m> and then to <m>(1,-4)</m>,
          which is not the same as the point <m>(1,-3)</m> that lies on <m>m(x)=2r(x+1)-1</m>.
        </p>

      Some graphs do not change under certain transformations.
      For example,
      the graph of <m>f(x) = x^2</m> shown in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage66a" autoname="yes"/> below remains the same if we reflect it across the <m>y</m>-axis.
      We say that this function has <em><m>y</m>-axis symmetry</em>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_taalmanpage66a">
      <caption><m>y=x^2</m> is preserved under reflection across the <m>y</m>-axis.</caption>
      <image width="80%" source="TaalmanPage66a.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      As another example, the graph of
      <m>g(x) = x^3</m> shown in <xref ref="fig_taalmanpage66b" autoname="yes"/> below remains the same if we reflect it first across the <m>y</m>-axis and then across the <m>x</m>-axis.
      This double-reflection across the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axis is equivalent to rotation around the origin by <m>180^\circ</m>.
      Take a moment to experiment with this:
      on a piece of scrap paper, draw a smiley face or some other picture.
      Flip the paper vertically and then horizontally
      (or horizontally and then vertically).
      This gives you the same result as rotating the paper by 180 degrees.
      A function that is preserved under the transformation of
      <m>180^\circ</m> rotation is said to have <m>180^\circ</m>
      <em>rotational symmetry</em>.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      These types of symmetries are also called <em>even symmetry</em>
      and <em>odd symmetry</em>,
      since power functions with even powers all have <m>y</m>-axis symmetry and power functions with odd powers all have rotational symmetry.
      Because graphical reflections correspond to multiplication by <m>-1</m>,
      we can describe functions with even and odd symmetry algebraically as follows:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <title>Even and Odd Functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Even functions have <m>y</m>-axis symmetry while odd functions have rotational symmetry:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                A function <m>f</m> is an <em>even function</em>
                if <m>f(-x)=f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A function <m>f</m> is an <em>odd function</em>
                if <m>f(-x)=-f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For example,
      the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m> is even because for all <m>x</m> we have
      <me>
        f(-x) = (-x)^2 = (-1)^2(x)^2 = x^2 = f(x)
      </me>.
      In contrast,
      the function <m>g(x) = x^3</m> is odd because for all <m>x</m> we have
      <me>
        g(-x) = (-x)^3 = (-1)^3(x)^3 = -x^3 = -g(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that many functions are neither even nor odd.
      In fact, it is quite hard for a function to be either even or odd,
      since this would require the graph to have one of these two specific symmetries.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>h(x) = x^2+x</m> is neither even nor odd.
          <me>
            h(-x) = (-x)^2+(-x) = x^2-x
          </me>
          and so we can see that <m>h(-x)\neq h(x)</m>,
          thus <m>h(x)</m> is not even.
          Similarly, since <m>-h(x) = -x^2-x</m>,
          we can also see that <m>h(-x)\neq -h(x)</m>,
          thus <m>h(x)</m> is not odd.
          Consequently, the function
          <m>h(x) = x^2+x</m> has neither <m>y</m>-axis symmetry nor rotational symmetry.
          Confirm this for yourself by graphing <m>h(x)</m> using Desmos or a graphing calculator.

          We first determine algebraically whether each function satisfies the definition of even or odd

          and then verify graphically.

                To determine whether <m>f</m> is even or odd
                (or neither)
                we must calculate <m>f(-x)</m> and determine if it is equal to <m>f(x), -f(x)</m>,
                or neither.
                If <m>f(-x)=f(x)</m>, it is even,
                and if <m>f(-x)=-f(x)</m>, it is odd.
                We have
                <me>
                  f(-x) = \frac{1}{-x} = -\frac{1}{x}  = -f(x)
                </me>,
                so <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> is an odd function since it satisfies <m>f(-x)=-f(x)</m>.

                We follow the same procedure to determine whether <m>g(x)</m> is even, odd,
                or neither.
                If <m>g(-x)=g(x)</m>, it is even,
                if <m>g(-x)=-g(x)</m>, it is odd,
                and if neither of those two things is true,
                then it is neither even nor odd.
                Well
                <me>
                  g(-x) = (-x)^4-(-x)^2  = x^4-x^2 = g(x)
                </me>,
                so <m>g(x)</m> is an even function.

            <li>
              <p>
                Following the same line of reasoning,
                we must examine <m>h(-x)</m> to determine if it is equal to either <m>h(x)</m> or <m>-h(x)</m>,
                or neither.
                <me>
                  h(-x) = \frac{2+(-x)}{1+(-x)^2} = \frac{2-x}{1+x^2}
                </me>.
                This does not appear to be equal to either <m>h(x)</m> or <m>-h(x)</m>.
                Indeed,
                <me>
                  -h(x) = -\frac{2+x}{1+x^2} = \frac{-2-x}{1+x^2}\neq h(-x) =  \frac{2-x}{1+x^2}
                </me>.
                Hence the function <m>h(x)</m> is neither even nor odd.

    <title>Application: The Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function</title>
    <p>
      There is another "standard" form in which you may see a quadratic function,
      called the <em>vertex form</em>:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <title>Vertex form of a quadratic function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A quadratic function with vertex <m>(h,k)</m> may be written in the form
          <me>
            y=a(x-h)^2+k
          </me>.
          The constant <m>a</m> may be determined from one other point on the graph of the function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This form arises from taking the parabola
      <m>f(x)=x^2</m> and applying appropriate transformations to obtain any other parabola as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First, shift <m>f(x)=x^2</m> horizontally via <m>f(x-h)</m>.
            If the parabola must shift to the right,
            use a positive value for <m>h</m>.
            If the parabola must shift to the left,
            use a negative value for <m>h</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Next, stretch the parabola vertically via <m>af(x-h)</m>.
            If the parabola must shrink,
            use a value of <m>a</m> that is between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>.
            If the parabola must be reflected across the <m>x</m>-axis,
            use a negative value of <m>a</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Finally, shift the parabola vertically via <m>af(x-h)+k</m>.
            If the parabola must shift up,
            use a positive value for <m>k</m>.
            If the parabola must shift down,
            use a negative value for <m>k</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can reason graphically via transformations of <m>y=x^2</m> to determine whether the parabola
          <me>
            p(x) = -3(x+1)^2+9
          </me>
          has 0, 1, or 2 <m>x</m>-intercepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vertex of the parabola has shifted left by one unit (<m>h=-1</m>) and up by nine units (<m>k=9</m>) from the graph of <m>y=x^2</m>,
          so the vertex of <m>p(x)</m> is in the second quadrant at the point <m>(-1,9)</m>.
          The coefficient of <m>-3</m> has reflected the graph over the <m>x</m>-axis,
          so <m>p(x)</m> opens downward.
          Thus we know that <m>p(x)</m> must have 2 <m>x</m>-intercepts.
          See if you can find them algebraically.

          Recall from Exercise <xref ref="ex_quadraticparameters" autoname="yes"/> that we explored how the parameters <m>a, b</m>,

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    transformations: vertical, horizontal, vertical stretch or compression, horizontal stretch or compression, reflection; <m>y</m>-axis symmetry and even functions; <m>180^\circ</m> rotational symmetry and odd functions; the vertex form of a quadratic equation
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Adding, subtracting, multiplying,
      or dividing a function by a number results a predictable change in the graph that leaves some aspects of the shape of the graph unchanged.
      Some graphs have particular types of symmetry that confer special names on those functions
      (even and odd),
      and we can determine algebraically whether or not a function has these types of symmetry.
