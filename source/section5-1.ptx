    <title>Curves Described by Equations</title>
    <p>
      In all of our studies with derivatives so far,
      we have worked with functions where the value of the dependent variable
      (often <m>y</m>)
      is given explicitly in terms of the value of the independent variable
      (often <m>x</m>).
      But there are many interesting curves that are defined by equations involving variables that are impossible to solve for one in terms of the other.
      In this section,
      you will see several examples of such curves and learn how to use calculus to study such curves in the absence of an explicit formula.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_lemniscate">
      <title>A Lemniscate</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The curve pictured below, called a <em>lemniscate</em>,
          is the collection of points that satisfy the equation <m>x^3-y^3 = 6xy</m>:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_ACFigure2-7-1b">
          <caption>The lemniscate defined by the equation <m>x^3-y^3=6xy</m>.</caption>
          <image width="37%" source="ACFigure2-7-1b.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          What does it mean for a point to "satisfy the equation?" It means that when we plug in the values of the variables given by the point,
          we get a true statement from the equation.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, if <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m>,
          then the left side of the equation <m>x^3-y^3 = 6xy</m> is
          <me>
            x^3-y^3 = 0^3-0^3 = 0
          </me>
          and the right side of the equation is
          <me>
            6xy = 6(0)(0) = 0
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since both sides of the equation evaluate to the same number,
          they are equal to each other for the given values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
          making the equation "true." Hence the point
          <m>(x,y)=(0,0)</m> "satisfies the equation"
          <m>x^3-y^3 = 6xy</m> and is included on the curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, if <m>x=-3</m> and <m>y=3</m>,
          then the left side of the equation <m>x^3-y^3 = 6xy</m> is
          <me>
            x^3-y^3 = (-3)^3-(3)^3 = -27-27=-54
          </me>
          and the right side of the equation is
          <me>
            6xy = 6(-3)(3) = -54
          </me>
          so the point <m>(-3,3)</m> also satisfied the equation and is on the curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a moment to find the points <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(-3,3)</m> on the curve in <xref ref="fig_ACFigure2-7-1b" autoname="yes"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see that the lemniscate does not pass the vertical line test <mdash/> for example,
          the line <m>x=-2</m> passes through the curve at three different <m>y</m>-values.
          Because the vertical line test fails,
          we know that the curve cannot be the graph of a function <m>y=f(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <title>A Circle</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Perhaps the simplest and most natural of all such curves are circles.
          Because of the circle's symmetry,
          for each <m>x</m> value strictly between the endpoints of the horizontal diameter,
          there are two corresponding <m>y</m>-values.
          For instance,
          in <xref ref="fig_ACFig2-7-1a">Figure</xref> below,
          we have labeled <m>A=(-3,\sqrt{7})</m> and <m>B=(-3,-\sqrt{7})</m>,
          and these points demonstrate that the circle fails the vertical line test.
          Hence it is impossible to represent the circle through a single function of the form <m>y=f(x)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          But portions of the circle can be represented explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>,
          such as the highlighted arc that is magnified to the right of <xref ref="fig_ACFig2-7-1a">Figure</xref> below:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_ACFig2-7-1a">
          <caption>At left, the circle given by <m>x^2+y^2=16</m>. At right, the portion of the circle <m>x^2+y^2=16</m> that has been highlighted in the box at left.</caption>
          <image width="65%" source="ACFigure2-7-1a.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Moreover, we ought to be able to find a tangent line to the curve at every point since the graph appears to be smooth
          (without any breaks, cusps, corners, or vertical parts).
          Thus it makes sense to wonder if we can compute
          <m>\dfrac{dy}{dx}</m> at any point on the circle,
          even though we cannot write <m>y</m> explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>.
          We say that the equation <m>x^2+y^2=16</m> defines <m>y</m> <em>implicitly</em>
          as a function of <m>x</m>.

          The curve below is called a <em>quadrifolium</em>

          Plug the points <m>(0,0)</m> and
          <m>\left(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\dfrac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)</m> into both sides of the equation <m>(x^2+y^2)^3 = 4x^2y^2</m>.
          Simplify each side and observe that the values are equal,
          so that the points "satisfy the equation"
          <m>(x^2+y^2)^3 = 4x^2y^2</m>, and so lie on the curve.
          Based on the picture,
          do you think there are tangent lines at these points?

      <statement>
        <p>
          For a circle,
          the graph of the equation could be broken into pieces where each piece can be defined by an explicit function of <m>x</m>.
          Below we see the circle <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> broken into the top and bottom half.

          These halves correspond to the two expressions,
          <m>\sqrt{1-x^2}</m> and <m>-\sqrt{1-x^2}</m>,
          that we get when we solve the equation for <m>y</m>:

            \begin{aligned}x^2+y^2 \amp = 1\\ y^2 \amp = 1-x^2\\ y \amp = \pm\sqrt{1-x^2} \end{aligned}

      For the lemniscate in Example <xref ref="ex_lemniscate" autoname="yes"/> or the quadrifolium in Exercise <xref ref="exercise_quadrifolium" autoname="yes"/>,
      we would need many more pieces and it is algebraically <em>extremely</em>
      difficult to solve either of those equations for <m>y</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Finding Derivatives of Implicit Functions</title>
    <p>
      The following three examples remind us of some ways we can compute derivatives of functions in settings where the function's formula is not known.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a differentiable function of <m>x</m>
          (whose formula is not known)
          and recall that <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m> and <m>f'(x)</m> mean the same thing:
          the derivative of <m>f</m>.
          Then
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[x^2+f(x)] = 2x+\frac{df}{dx}
          </me>
          where we have used the sum rule to take the derivative of each term separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, if we are told that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m> and wish to take the derivative of <m>x^2+y</m>,
          we can write:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[x^2+y] = x^2+\frac{dy}{dx}
          </me>
          where <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> means "take the derivative of <m>y</m> using <m>x</m> as the variable."
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is a differentiable function,
          find an expression in terms of
          <m>x,
          f</m>, and <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m> for
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[x^2f(x)]
          </me>.
          Similarly, if <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>,
          find the derivative of <m>x^2y</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The derivative of <m>x^2f(x)</m> requires us to use the product rule,
          because we are multiplying <m>x^2</m> and <m>f(x)</m>:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[x^2f(x)] = (2x)\cdot f(x)+(x^2)\cdot \frac{df}{dx} = 2xf(x)+x^2\frac{df}{dx}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, if <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>,
          then <m>x^2y</m> is also a product of <m>x^2</m> and <m>y</m>,
          so we use the product rule to take the derivative:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[x^2y] = 2xy+x^2\frac{dy}{dx}
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="ex_implicitchain">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f(x)</m> is a differentiable function with derivative <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m>, then
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[(f(x))^2] = 2f(x)\, f'(x)
          </me>
          by the chain rule.
          Likewise,
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[(f(x))^3] = 3(f(x))^2\, f'(x)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we use the variable <m>y</m> in place of <m>f(x)</m>,
          and specify that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>,
          then we must still use the chain rule in order to compute the following derivatives:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y\,\frac{dy}{dx}
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[y^3] = 3y^2\,\frac{dy}{dx}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The key idea being used is that we can treat the variable <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> while taking the derivative.
      In other words, we treat <m>y</m> as an
      <em>implicit function</em> of <m>x</m>.
      In so doing, we can "compute" the derivative of <m>y</m> as
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> without having a formula for <m>y</m>,
      and we can also "compute" the derivative of equations involving the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> without needing to solve for <m>y</m> explicitly.
      This process is what is called <em>implicit differentiation</em>
      and is demonstrated fully in the next example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>The Circle</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's consider again the example of the circle given by <m>x^2+y^2 = 16</m>.
          How can we find a formula for the derivative <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>?
        </p>
        <p>
          By viewing <m>y</m> as an implicit function of <m>x</m>,
          we think of <m>y</m> as some function whose formula <m>f(x)</m> is unknown,
          but which we can differentiate.
          Just as <m>y</m> represents an unknown formula,
          we can treat its derivative
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> as an unknown formula;
          we use it purely as a symbol.
        </p>
        <p>
          Viewing <m>y</m> as an unknown differentiable function of <m>x</m>,
          we take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[x^2+y^2] = \frac{d}{dx}[16]
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          On the right,
          the derivative of the constant <m>16</m> is <m>0</m>,
          and on the left we can apply the sum rule, so it follows that
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[x^2]+\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] =0
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pay attention to the different roles being played by <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
          Because <m>x</m> is the independent variable,
          <m>\frac{d}{dx}[x^2]=2x</m> as usual.
          But <m>y</m> is the dependent variable,
          meaning <m>y</m> is an implicit function of <m>x</m>.
          Recall <xref ref="ex_implicitchain">Example</xref>,
          where we computed <m>\frac{d}{dx}[(f(x))^2] = 2f(x)\, f'(x)</m>.
          Computing <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2]</m> is exactly the same,
          and requires the chain rule,
          by which we find that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y\,\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The derivative of the equation <m>x^2+y^2=16</m> is then
          <me>
            2x+2y\,\frac{dy}{dx} = 0
          </me>
          once we put together the left and right sides computed above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we can solve this equation for
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> by subtracting <m>2x</m> from both sides and dividing by <m>2y</m>,
          then canceling the 2.
          Some people refer to this as "isolating <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>."
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}2x+2y\,\frac{dy}{dx} \amp = 0\\ 2y\frac{dy}{dx}  \amp = -2x\\ \frac{dy}{dx} \amp =\frac{-2x}{2y}\\ \frac{dy}{dx} \amp = -\frac{x}{y} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          And voila!
          We have managed to compute the derivative
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> without ever knowing an explicit formula for <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>.
        </p>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We begin by differentiating the curve's equation implicitly,
          meaning by treating <m>y</m> as an implicit function of <m>x</m>.

          </me>,
          by the sum rule and the fact that the derivative of a constant is zero, we have
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[x^3]+\frac{d}{dx}[y^2]-\frac{d}{dx}[2xy] = 0

        <p>
          We have three derivatives to compute.
          <m>\frac{d}{dx}[x^3]</m> uses the power rule applied to the variable <m>x</m>.
          <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2]</m> requires the chain rule since <m>y</m> is an implicit function of <m>x</m>.
          And <m>\frac{d}{dx}[2xy]</m> requires the product rule since <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m> and we are multiplying <m>2x</m> by <m>y</m>.
          Applying these rules, we now find that
          <me>
            3x^2+2y\frac{dy}{dx}-\left(2x\frac{dy}{dx}+2y\right) = 0
          </me>.

        <p>
          Now we want to solve this equation for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
          To do so, we first collect all of the terms involving
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> on one side of the equation,

    <title>Tangent Lines to Implicitly Defined Curves</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have a formula for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>,
      meaning the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to the variable <m>x</m>,
      we can find equations for tangent lines.
      Remember that the value of the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line.
      We simply plug in the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-coordinate of the point to the expression for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>,
      as demonstrated in the next example.
      We use the notation
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{(x,y)=(a,b)}
      </me>
      to denote the <em>evaluation of
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> at the point <m>(a,b)</m></em>.
      This is analogous to writing
      <m>f'(a) = \frac{df}{dx}\Big|_{x=a}</m> when <m>f'(x)</m> is the derivative of an explicit function.

          This is not a factorization that we can do by hand,

        <p>
          If <m>(y-2)(y^2+2y-1)=0</m> we must have either <m>y-2=0</m> or <m>y^2+2y-1=0</m>.

    <title>Vertical and Horizontal Tangent Lines</title>
    <p>
      On an explicitly defined function,
      we say that the derivative is undefined at points where the tangent line is vertical,
      since we do not have an explicit value of the derivative at those points.
      However, on an implicitly defined curve,
      we wish to also consider vertical tangent lines since we are not restricting ourselves to explicit functions.
      While the slope of a horizontal tangent line must be zero,
      the slope of a vertical tangent line is infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many of the examples we have considered,
      the formula for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is expressed as a fraction of expressions involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>:
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{p(x,y)}{q(x,y)}
      </me>.
      The tangent line is horizontal precisely when
      <m>p(x,y)=0</m> and <m>q(x,y)\neq 0</m>,
      making the slope of the tangent line zero.
      Similarly, the tangent line is vertical whenever
      <m>q(x,y)=0</m> and <m>p(x,y)\neq 0</m>,
      making the slope infinite.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the curve defined by the equation
          <me>

          Implicit differentiation can show that
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{(x-1)(x-2)+x(x-2)+x(x-1)}{(y^2-1)(y-2)+2y^2(y-2)+y(y^2-1)}
          </me>.
          We won't take the time to do that calculation.
          It's very long and tedious.
          I calculated it using a Computer Algebra System called Mathematica.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we simplify the numerator of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, we get
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}(x-1)(x-2)+x(x-2)+x(x-1) \amp = (x^2-3x+2)+(x^2-2x)+(x^2-x) \\ \amp = 3x^2-6x+2. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting this equal to zero and solving for <m>x</m> using the quadratic formula:
          <me>
            3x^2-6x+2 = 0  \text{ when }  x=1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \text{ and }  x=1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This tells us that the curve has a horizontal tangent line when <m>x=1\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}</m>
          (provided that the denominator of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is nonzero).
          This looks reasonable based on the graph,
          since we can see that there should be horizontal tangent lines at the four points on the curve where
          <m>x = 1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\approx 0.42265</m> and at the four points on the curve where <m>x = 1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\approx1.5774</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tangent line will be vertical when the denominator is equal to zero
          (provided that the numerator is nonzero).
          Simplifying the denominator, we get
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}(y^2-1)(y-2)+2y^2(y-2)+y(y^2-1) \amp = (y^3-2y^2-y+2)+2y^3-4y^2+y^3-y\\ \amp = 4 y^3 - 6 y^2 - 2 y + 2 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot easily factor <m>4 y^3 - 6 y^2 - 2 y + 2</m> in order to determine where it is equal to zero.
          I typed "Solve <m>4 y^3 - 6 y^2 - 2 y + 2=0</m>" into the website

          Comparing these numbers to what's shown on the graph,
          we can see that there should be vertical tangent lines at three points at the three different <m>y</m>-values.

          Use implicit differentiation to find
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> and determine the equation of the tangent line to the lemniscate
          <me>
            x^3-y^3=6xy
          </me>
          at the point <m>(-3,3)</m>.
          Then verify that <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is undefined at the point <m>(0,0)</m>.
          What appears to be happening to the tangent line at <m>(0,0)</m>?

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    implicit function, implicit differentiation, evaluation of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> at the point <m>(a,b)</m>:
    <me>
      \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{(x,y)=(a,b)}
    </me>
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Curves can be defined by equations that are not explicit functions,
      and we can use implicit differentiation to compute derivatives in order to find slopes of tangent lines to the curves.
      The chain rule is used to take derivatives of variables implicitly defined as a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      Equations of lines can be found using a point and a slope.
      The slope of a tangent line is the derivative evaluated at the point of tangency.
      Tangent lines are horizontal when their slopes are zero.
      Tangent lines are vertical when their slopes are infinite.
