    <title>A Few New Indeterminate Forms</title>
    <p>
      Recall that if a limit is <em>indeterminate</em>,
      then we cannot initially say whether or not it exists<ndash/>or if it exists,
      what real number it is equal to.
      Many indeterminate limits can be resolved with algebra such as cancellation or factoring.
      Certain other indeterminate limits can be resolved by applying L'H&#xf4;pital's rule,
      or some combination of algebra and L'H&#xf4;pital's rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following theorem identifies the seven indeterminate limit forms that are commonly encountered.
      We have already explored the first four forms
      (and will summarize methods for analyzing them in the last part of this section).
      The last three forms will be explored in depth in this section:
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Each of the following is an <em>indeterminate form,</em>
          meaning that a limit in one of these forms may or may not exist,
          depending on the details of the situation:
          <me>
            \frac{0}{0}\qquad \frac{\infty}{\infty}\qquad 0\cdot\infty\qquad \infty-\infty\qquad 0^0\qquad 1^\infty \qquad \infty^0
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Why are limits of the form <m>0^0, 1^\infty</m>,
      and <m>\infty^0</m> indeterminate?
      There is an inherent "conflict" in each of these forms that prevents us from knowing intuitively what the limit is equal to.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If a limit has the form <m>0^0</m>,
          then the base is a number approaching 0 and the exponent is a number approaching 0;
          neither are exactly equal to 0.
          Let's explore the value of such a limit intuitively and see where the conflict arrises.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the one hand,
          any number raised to the 0 power should be equal to 1.
          So you could argue that such a limit form should be equal to 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand,
          a base of 0 raised to any power should be equal to 0.
          So you could also argue that such a limit form should be equal to 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further still,
          if we consider the exponent to be a slightly negative number and the base to be a very small positive number,
          we seem to get either a finite number or a number that may eventually go to infinity.
          For example,
          if the exponent is <m>-0.1</m> and the base starts at <m>0.00001</m> and gets closer to 0:
        </p>
        <tabular>
          <row>
            <cell><m>0.00001^{-0.1}</m></cell>
            <cell><m>0.000001^{-0.1}</m></cell>
            <cell><m>0.0000001^{-0.1}</m></cell>
            <cell><m>0.00000001^{-0.1}</m></cell>
          </row>
          <row bottom="minor">
            <cell></cell>
            <cell></cell>
            <cell></cell>
            <cell></cell>
          </row>
          <row>
            <cell><m>\approx3.162</m></cell>
            <cell><m>\approx3.981</m></cell>
            <cell><m>\approx5.012</m></cell>
            <cell><m>\approx6.310</m></cell>
          </row>
        </tabular>
        <p>
          All this is to demonstrate that a limit of the form <m>0^0</m> could be equal to <em>anything</em>
          and that <em>none of the intuitive arguments above are precise enough for us to know!</em>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit form <m>1^\infty</m> is similarly indeterminate when we remember that the base could be a number slightly less than or slightly greater than 1, while the exponent is a number that gets very large.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example,
          <m>1.1^{1,000,000}\approx 4.84\times10^{41392}</m> is VERY large,
          while <m>0.9^{1,000,000}\approx 3.23\times10^{-45758}</m> is VERY small.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which of these is correct?
          Neither, really.
          We have no way of knowing the value of such a limit without more detailed analysis.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Similar to the previous two examples,
          give intuitive explanations for the "conflict" in the indeterminate form <m>\infty^0</m>.
          In other words,
          explain how this limit form could potentially be equal to a finite number and how it could potentially be equal to an infinite number.
          <em>Note that there is no "right" answer to what this limit form could be equal to besides the observation that no intuition will tell us definitively what such a form is equal to.</em>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      In contrast to the above examples,
      note that the following limit forms are NOT indeterminate:
      <me>
        0^\infty\qquad 0^1\qquad \infty^\infty\qquad \infty^1
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two (<m>0^\infty</m> and <m>0^1</m>) must both be equal to 0
      (can you see why?)
      while the second two (<m>\infty^\infty</m> and
      <m>\infty^1</m>) must both be infinite
      (again, can you see why?
      Assume that by "<m>\infty</m>" we mean here a very large positive number).
    </p>

    <title>Indeterminate Limits of the Form <m>0^0, 1^\infty</m>, and <m>\infty^0</m></title>
    <p>
      Let's examine a few explicit limits to see if we can gain any further insight into the forms
      <m>0^0, 1^\infty</m>, and <m>\infty^0</m>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_infindetexample1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to\infty}\left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right)^{x^2}
          </me>.
          First note that the base <m>\frac{x}{x-1}</m> approaches 1 as <m>x\to\infty</m>,
          while the exponent <m>x^2</m> approaches <m>\infty</m> as <m>x\to\infty</m>.
          Thus the limit has the form <m>1^\infty</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at a table of values:
        </p>
        <tabular>
          <row>

        <p>
          This limit seems to be approaching <m>\infty</m>.
          How can we confirm this?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="ex_infindetexample2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the limit
          <me>

          </me>.
          The base approaches <m>1</m> while the exponent
          <m>\frac{1}{x^2-1}</m> approaches <m>\frac{1}{0^+} = \infty</m>,
          so the limit has the form <m>1^\infty</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again looking at a table of values:
        </p>

          <row>

        <p>
          It seems like this limit is approaching something around <m>1.65</m>,
          but what is the exact value, and how can we be sure?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      In each of these limits there is a race between how fast the base approaches 1 and how fast the exponent approaches <m>\infty</m>,
      an in some sense the winner of that race determines the limit.
      But how can we determine who wins this race?
    </p>
    <p>
      One difficulty with limits of the indeterminate forms <m>0^0, 1^\infty</m>,
      and <m>\infty^0</m> is that such limits involve a variable in <em>both</em>
      the base <em>and</em> the exponent.
      Fortunately,
      logarithms have the power to change exponentiation into multiplication,
      in the sense that <m>\ln(a^b) = b\ln a</m>.
      The key to using logarithms to calculate limits is the following theorem:
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Relating the Limit of a Function to the Limit of its Logarithm</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For a function <m>f(x)</m> such that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to c}\ln(f(x)) = L
          </me>,
          then
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to c}f(x) = e^L
          </me>.
          In particular,
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>L=\infty</m>,
                then <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c}f(x) = \ds\lim_{u\to\infty} e^u = \infty</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>L=-\infty</m>,
                then <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c}f(x) = \ds\lim_{u\to-\infty} e^u = 0</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This theorem is true because of the composition rule for limits of continuous functions from <xref ref="thm_limitrules">Theorem</xref>.
      To use this theorem to calculate a limit of the form
      <me>
        \lim_{x\to c}u(x)^{v(x)}
      </me>,
      we consider instead the <em>different</em> limit
      <me>
        \ln\left(\lim_{x\to c}u(x)^{v(x)}\right) = \lim_{x\to c}\ln(u(x)^{v(x)}) = \lim_{x\to c} v(x)\ln(u(x))
      </me>.
      <xref ref="thm_limitrules">Theorem</xref>
      is what allows us to reverse the order of the limit and the natural logarithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the logarithm allows us to consider the limit of a product rather than a limit involving an exponent;
      our previous methods will be much more effective with this new limit.
      Once we find the value <m>L</m> of this different limit,
      the theorem tells us that the answer to our original limit must be <m>e^L</m>.
      In other words,
      we take the natural logarithm to evaluate the limit,
      so we must undo this by raising <m>e</m> to the limit:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\ln(\text{ limit } ) \amp = L\\ \text{ limit }  \amp = e^L \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, if instead of a finite number for <m>L</m> we get <m>L=\pm\infty</m>,
      then our original limit must be equal to <m>\lim_{u\to\pm\infty}e^{u}</m>,
      which is either <m>0</m> or <m>\infty</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at some explicit examples applying this method.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_einfinitelimit">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)^x
          </me>
          has the form <m>1^\infty</m>.
          After taking <m>\ln</m> we have the
          <em>different limit</em>
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to\infty} \ln\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)^x = \lim_{x\to\infty}x\cdot\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>x\to\infty</m> and <m>\ln(1) =0</m>,
          this limit has the form <m>\infty\cdot 0</m>.
          It is still indeterminate, but is a different type of indeterminate limit.
          We can solve it by moving the <m>x</m> to the denominator and applying L'H&#xf4;pital's rule:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to\infty}x\cdot\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right) \amp = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)}{x^{-1}} \amp  \leftarrow \text{ algebra: } x = \frac{1}{x^{-1}}\\ \amp =\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)}{\frac{1}{x}} \amp \leftarrow \text{ now of the form }  \frac{0}{0}\\ \amp \stackrel[L'H]{}=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x}}\cdot -\frac{1}{x^2}}{-\frac{1}{x^2}} \amp \leftarrow\text{ applying L'H\^opital's rule } \\ \amp =\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x}}\amp \leftarrow\text{ simplifying by cancelling } -\frac{1}{x^2}\\ \amp = \frac{1}{1+0} = 1 \amp \leftarrow\text{ evaluating the limit } \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that this is equal to the natural logarithm of our original limit:
          <me>
            \ln\left(\lim_{x\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)^x\right) = 1
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus our original limit is equal to <m>e^1 = e</m>:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)^x = e

          Recalling that we had to take the natural logarithm and must now undo this:

            \lim_{x\to\infty}\left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right)^{x^2} = e^\infty = \infty

        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The above calculations are not exactly easy or pleasant,
      but they mainly involve some careful and stubborn algebraic manipulation,
      along with an application of L'H&#xf4;pital's rule.
      This is fairly typical of these types of limit.
      Here are a few general principles to keep in mind:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            At each step in a limit calculation,
            the problem should be viewed through the lens of a fresh problem.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Limits of the form <m>0\cdot\infty</m> should be converted to a form so that L'H&#xf4;pital's rule can be used.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            An expression that can be simplified should be simplified before attempting to evaluate the limit again.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Looking at the limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1^+} x^{1/(x^2-1)}
          </me>
          from <xref ref="ex_infindetexample2">Example</xref>,
          we again begin by taking the natural logarithm and moving the exponent down:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to 1^+} \ln\left(x^{1/(x^2-1)}\right) \amp = \lim_{x\to1^+} \frac{1}{x^2-1}\cdot\ln(x)\amp \leftarrow\text{ form } \infty\cdot 0\\ \amp =\lim_{x\to1^+}\frac{\ln(x)}{x^2-1} \amp \leftarrow\text{ form } \frac{0}{0}\\ \amp \stackrel[L'H]{}= \lim_{x\to1+}\frac{1/x}{2x}\amp \leftarrow\text{ L'H\^opital's } \\ \amp =\lim_{x\to1^+}\frac{1}{2x^2}\amp \leftarrow\text{ simplifying } \\ \amp = \frac{1}{2}\amp \leftarrow\text{ evaluating } \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We've seen that <m>\ln(\text{ original limit } ) = \frac{1}{2}</m> and thus the original limit is <m>e^{1/2} = \sqrt{e}</m>.
          Hence
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1^+} x^{1/(x^2-1)} = \sqrt{e}
          </me>
          and now we've discovered that the value the table in <xref ref="ex_infindetexample2">Example</xref>
          was approaching <m>\sqrt{e}\approx 1.6487</m>!
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Follow the steps below in order to evaluate
          <me>

            <li>
              <p>
                Convert the limit to the form
                <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> and apply L'H&#xf4;pital's rule.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Simplify completely and evaluate the limit.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Return to the original limit by raising <m>e</m> to what you got in the previous step.
              </p>

          </ul>

    <p>
      Here are a few more examples of evaluating limits using this method.
      The first and last steps are always the same
      (begin by taking the natural logarithm,
      end by raising <m>e</m> to the result of the calculation).
      However, the intermediate steps vary depending on the function involved.
      <em>Pay close attention to the form of the limit after each step.</em>

          <m>\infty^0</m> since <m>x\to\infty</m> and

    <title>Summary of Methods for Indeterminate Limits</title>
    <p>
      Below is a summary of methods to use for evaluating each type of indeterminate limit.
      However, before applying any of these methods,
      remember to try the easiest computations first as your limit may or may not be indeterminate:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Attempt to evaluate the limit as written.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Try any obvious algebraic simplifications and reevaluate the limit.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless you get one of the limit forms below,
      the limit is <em>not</em> indeterminate and can be evaluated without any further computation.<fn>
      The exception to this is limits of the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>.
      These are <em>not</em> indeterminate; they are infinite.
      However, they may need to be split into left and right limits to evaluate completely.
      See <xref ref="sec_infinitelimits">Section</xref> for a detailed discussion.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Form <m>\mathbf{\frac{0}{0}}</m>:</em>
      Either attempt to factor and cancel or else apply L'H&#xf4;pital's rule.
      Simplify and reevaluate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Form <m>\mathbf{\frac{\infty}{\infty}}</m>:</em>
      If this is the limit at infinity of a rational function,
      apply the methods from <xref ref="sec_endbehaviorofrationalfunctions">Section</xref>,
      or use a variation of these methods as in <xref ref="sec_examplesoflimitsoflogandexpfunctions">Section</xref>
      if the expression involves exponential functions.
      Otherwise apply L'H&#xf4;pital's rule.
      Simplify and reevaluate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Form <m>\mathbf{0\cdot\infty}</m>:</em>
      Rewrite in either the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> or
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> by moving one of the factors to the denominator with an exponent of <m>-1</m>.
      Then apply L'H&#xf4;pital's rule, simplify, and reevaluate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Form <m>\mathbf{\infty-\infty}</m>:</em>
      If this is the limit at infinity of a polynomial,
      apply <xref ref="thm_endbehaviorofpolynomials">Theorem</xref>.
      Otherwise, either factor or combine denominators into a single fraction if one or both terms is a fraction
      (or can be written as a fraction,
      such as with some of the trigonometric functions).
      Then reevaluate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Forms <m>\mathbf{0^0, 1^\infty}</m>,
      and <m>\mathbf{\infty^0}</m>:</em>
      Take the natural logarithm of the limit and bring down the exponent.
      The new limit will be of the form <m>0\cdot\infty</m>,
      so follow the method outlined above for that form.
      At the end of the computation,
      remember to return to the original limit by raising <m>e</m> to what you have computed as <m>\ln(\text{ original limit } )</m>.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following indeterminate limit forms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    <m>0^0, 1^\infty</m>, and <m>\infty^0</m>
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Use a logarithm to evaluate limits of the form
      <m>0^0, 1^\infty</m>, and <m>\infty^0</m>,
      remembering to raise <m>e</m> to the value you get in order to return to the original limit.
      Apply L'H&#xf4;pital's rule carefully,
      checking for limits forms at each step of your computations and simplifying algebraically whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      Limits of the form <m>0\cdot\infty</m> can be rewritten in either the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> or
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> in order to apply L'H&#xf4;pital's rule.
