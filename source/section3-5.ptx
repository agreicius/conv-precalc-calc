    <title>The Cancellation Theorem</title>
    <p>
      In the last section,
      we saw that some limits at points outside the domain of a function become infinite when they have the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>.
      However, we also saw that some functions can have limits <em>of the form</em>
      <m>\mathbf{\frac{0}{0}}</m> at points that are not in their domains.
      In this section, we learn one way to calculate such limits:
      algebraic manipulation and cancellation.
      As we shall see,
      such limits are sometimes infinite and are sometimes finite.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, consider the limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1}\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}
          </me>.
          At <m>x=1</m>, the numerator is
          <m>(1)^2-1 = 0</m> and the denominator is <m>(1)-1=0</m>,
          and therefore the limit evaluates to
          <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> if we try to plug in <m>x=1</m>:.
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1}\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1} = \frac{(1)^2-1}{(1)-1}=\frac{0}{0}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a function, <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> is undefined.
          But remember that for limits,
          we wish to know the behavior near such points,
          so are not satisfied until we know precisely what happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately for us in this example,
          we can determine the limit by factoring the numerator and cancelling a common factor of <m>x-1</m> in the numerator and denominator:
          <me>
            \frac{x^2-1}{x-1} =\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1} = \begin{cases}x+1,\amp \text{ if } x\neq 1\\ \text{ undefined }  \amp  \text{ if } x=1 \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that limits describe the behavior of a function <em>near</em>
          the <m>x</m>-value of the limit.
          So if we look <em>near</em> <m>x=1</m>,
          we can cancel the <m>x-1</m> and evaluate the limit of the continuous function <m>x+1</m>:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to 1}(x+1) =1+1 = 2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cancellation of the common factor <m>x-1</m> is valid
          <em>within the limit computation</em>
          because <m>\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1}</m> and <m>x+1</m> are equal to each other anytime <m>x\neq 1</m>,
          and when we take the limit,
          we are not concerned with what happens <em>at</em>
          the point <m>x=1</m>, only nearby.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      In general, by definition,
      limits as <m>x\to c</m> never have anything to do with what happens at <m>x=c</m>,
      only near <m>x=c</m>, which proves the following theorem:
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_cancellationforlimits">
      <title>The Cancellation Theorem for Limits</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c}g(x)</m> exists,
          and <m>f</m> is a function that is equal to <m>g</m> for all <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>c</m> except possibly at <m>c</m> itself,
          then <m>\ds\lim_{x\to c}f(x) = \ds\lim_{x\to c}g(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      \fbox{What this theorem is saying is that we can simplify via cancellation within a limit,
      and we can use the value of the limit of the simplified function for the value of the original function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said slightly differently,
      if we have a function <m>f(x)</m> that is discontinuous at <m>x=c</m>,
      but we can algebraically simplify <m>f(x)</m> into a function <m>g(x)</m> that
      <em>is continuous</em> at <m>x=c</m>
      (or at least that has a limit at <m>x=c</m> that we know),
      then we can use the value of the limit of <m>g(x)</m> instead. }}
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's evaluate <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 1}\dfrac{2x^2+x-3}{x-1}</m>.
          At first, we get
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{2x^2+x-3}{x-1} = \frac{2(1)^2+1-3}{1-1} = \frac{0}{0}
          </me>,
          which is not helpful.
          However, we can factor the numerator and cancel:
          <me>
            \frac{2x^2+x-3}{x-1} = \frac{(2x+3)(x-1)}{x-1} = \begin{cases}2x+3,\amp \text{ if } x\neq1\\ \text{ undefined } ,\amp \text{ if } x=1. \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="thm_cancellationforlimits">Theorem</xref>, we have
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{2x^2+x-3}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to 1}(2x+3) = 2(1)+3 = 5
          </me>
          by the continuity of <m>2x+3</m> at <m>x=1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Recall <m>h(x) = \dfrac{x-3}{x^3 - 3 x^2 - 4 x + 12}</m> from Example <xref ref="ex_twoVAsoneHole" autoname="yes"/>.
          There, we factored
          <me>
            h(x) =  \frac{x-3}{ (x-3)(x-2)(x+2) }
          </me>
          and noted that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 3} h(x) = \frac{0}{0}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we see that we can simply cancel the common factor of <m>x-3</m> and evaluate:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 3} \frac{x-3}{ (x-3)(x-2)(x+2) }  = \lim_{x\to 3} \frac{1}{(x-2)(x+2)} = \frac{1}{(3-2)(3+2)} = \frac{1}{5}
          </me>.
          Thus our guess from the table in Example <xref ref="ex_twoVAsoneHole" autoname="yes"/> that the limit approaches <m>\frac{1}{5} = 0.2</m> was correct!
          There is NOT a vertical asymptote at <m>x=3</m>.
          Instead, there is a hole, a.k.a. removable discontinuity,
          because the original expression is undefined but the limit approaches a finite number.

      <title>Instantaneous Velocity as a Limit of Average Velocity</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Recall that in Example <xref ref="ex_fallingball" autoname="yes"/> we approximated the instantaneous velocity of a ball with position
          <me>
            s(t) = 64-16(t-1)^2
          </me>
          at the time <m>t=1</m> using smaller and smaller intervals that approached <m>t=1</m> from the left:
          <me>
            [0.5,1],  [0.9,1],  [0.99,1],  \ldots
          </me>
          and from the right:
          <me>
            [1,1.5], [1,1.1],   [1,1.01],  \ldots
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can use the notation <m>[1,1+h]</m> to represent each interval if we agree to reverse the order of the interval for negative values of <m>h</m>.
          For example, when <m>h=-0.5</m>, the interval is
          <me>
            [1,1+(-0.5)] = [1,0.5] = [0.5,1]
          </me>
          and when <m>h=-0.1</m>, the interval is
          <me>
            [1,1+(-0.1)] = [1,0.9] = [0.9,1]
          </me>.
          So when we consider intervals to the left of <m>t=1</m>,
          we are taking the limit as <m>h\to 0^-</m>.
          When we consider intervals to the right of <m>t=1</m>,
          we are taking limits as <m>h\to 0^+</m>.
          This idea leads to limit calculations that we will study in great depth at the beginning of Chapter 3.
          For the moment,
          note that we can find a general formula for the average velocity of <m>s(t)</m> on intervals <m>[1,1+h]</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}AV_{[1,1+h]} \amp = \frac{s(1+h)-s(1)}{(1+h)-1}\\ \amp = \frac{(64-16(1+h-1)^2) - (64-16(1-1)^2)}{(1+h)-1}\\ \amp = \frac{64-16h^2 - 64}{h}\\ \amp = \frac{-16h^2}{h} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we take <m>h\to 0</m>,
          meaning we let the interval shrink down to the point <m>t=1</m>,
          we get a limit of the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>,
          but as we've seen, we can cancel in order to evaluate the limit:
          <me>
            \lim_{h\to 0}AV_{[1,1+h]} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{-16h^2}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0}{-16h} = 0
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the limit of the average velocities
          (the instantaneous velocity)
          at <m>t=1</m> appears to indeed be 0, meaning that the ball is momentarily motionless in the air at <m>t=1</m> before beginning its descent back to the ground.
        </p>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Determine a simplified expression for
          <m>AV_{[3,3+h]}</m> for the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m>,
          and then take the limit as <m>h\to 0</m> to find a formula for the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f(x) = x^2</m> at <m>x=3</m>.

    <title>Indeterminate Limit Forms</title>
    <p>
      You have now been introduced to two different limit forms:
      <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> and <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
      Limits of the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> are always infinite,
      though we don't always know whether they are positive or negative infinity
      (or one of each from the right and left).
      Limits of the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> are what is called "indeterminate." If a limit is <em>indeterminate</em>,
      then we cannot initially say whether or not it exists <mdash/> or if it exists,
      what real number it is equal to.
      Many indeterminate limits can be resolved with algebra such as cancellation or factoring.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the four limits that follow are all initially of the indeterminate form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
          After some algebra, we see that three limits exist
          (and describe holes)
          and one limit becomes infinite
          (and describes a vertical asymptote).
          The three that exist are each equal to different real numbers.
          <ol marker="labeltextbfalphitemsep10pttopsep5pt">
            <li>
              <p>
                Consider <m>f(x) = \frac{x^2-2x+1}{x-1}</m> at <m>x=1</m>.
                Initially,
                <me>
                  \ds\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x^2-2x+1}{x-1} = \frac{1-2+1}{1-1} = \frac{0}{0}
                </me>
                However, we can factor the numerator:
                <m>x^2-2x+1 = (x-1)(x-1) = (x-1)^2</m> and then evaluate the limit by cancelling:
                <me>
                  \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{(x-1)^2}{x-1}  = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x-1}{1} = \frac{0}{1} = 0

                The function <m>f(x)</m> has a hole at the point <m>(1,0)</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                Now consider <m>g(x) = \frac{x-1}{(x-1)^3}</m> at <m>x=1</m>.
                Again, technically originally the limit has the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>:
                <me>
                  \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x-1}{(x-1)^3} = \frac{0}{0}
                </me>
                but we can cancel one of the factors of <m>x-1</m> and re-evaluate to get an infinite limit:
                <me>
                  \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x-1}{(x-1)^3} = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{1}{(x-1)^2} = \frac{1}{0^+} = \infty
                </me>
                The function <m>g(x)</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=1</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now consider <m>h(x) = \frac{x-1}{x-1}</m>.
                <m>h(x)</m> is undefined at <m>x=1</m> and the limit as <m>x\to 1</m> has the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
                However, when we simplify:
                <me>
                  \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x-1}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to 1}1 = 1
                </me>
                Thus <m>h(x)</m> is the constant function <m>y=1</m>,
                except for the hole at the point <m>(1,1)</m>.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Lastly, consider the function <m>k(x) = \frac{x-1}{3x-3}</m>,
                which is also undefined at <m>x=1</m>.
                We can factor a 3 from the denominator and then cancel:
                <me>
                  \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x-1}{3x-3}= \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x-1}{3(x-1)} = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
                </me>
                So <m>k(x)</m> is equal to the constant function <m>y=\frac{1}{3}</m>,
                except for the hole at the point <m>\left(1,\frac{1}{3}\right)</m>.

          Your friends Jamaal and Taylin are disagreeing about what it means for a limit form to be indeterminate.
          Jamaal says that such a limit "does not exist" while Taylin says that the limit could be either infinite or finite.

      Recall that limits of the form

      These limits are indeterminate because we do not know whether they exist
      (and are finite)
      or not.
      We have seen that some can be evaluated by algebra.
      On the other hand,
      limits of the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> are always infinite,
      but we don't know whether they are positive or negative.
      Some of these limits must be broken into separate right and left limits in order to determine their signs.
      In this section,
      we will focus on identifying which limit form we are dealing with,
      and how to best proceed once we have identified the form.
      Then, once we have finished evaluating the limit,
      we will interpret graphically whether it describes a hole or vertical asymptote.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{(x-1)^2}{x-1}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This function is undefined at <m>x=1</m>,
          with both the numerator and denominator being equal to 0, so the limit at <m>x=1</m> has the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
          For now, whenever we encounter this limit form,
          we attempt to apply the Cancellation Theorem.
          We can cancel and compute
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{(x-1)^2}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to 1} x-1 = 1-1 = 0
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>f(x)</m> has a hole at <m>(1,0)</m>,
          rather than a vertical asymptote, as the limit is finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a graph of <m>f(x) = \frac{(x-1)^2}{x-1}</m>,
          demonstrating the hole visually that we found via limits:

        </figure>
        <p>
          Note that the function <m>f(x) =  \frac{(x-1)^2}{x-1}</m> is equal to the function <m>y=x-1</m>,
          except at the point <m>x=1</m> where <m>f(x)</m> is undefined.
          We can write
          <me>
            f(x) = \begin{cases}x-1, \amp  x\neq 1\\ \text{ undefined } , \amp  x=1 \end{cases}

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Now consider
          <me>
            g(x) = \frac{x-1}{(x-1)^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we try to evaluate <m>\ds\lim_{x\to 1}g(x)</m> without canceling, we get
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x-1}{(x-1)^2} = \frac{0}{0}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancelling one of the factors of <m>x-1</m>,
          we can see that <m>g(x) = \frac{x-1}{(x-1)^2} = \frac{1}{x-1}</m> everywhere they are defined,
          meaning for <m>x\neq 1</m>.
          Now when we compute the limit as <m>x\to 1</m>,
          we see that we have the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>,
          so this limit is infinite:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1}g(x) = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{1}{x-1} = \frac{1}{0}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>x-1</m> changes sign at <m>x=1</m>,
          we compute the left and right limits separately and find that
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1^-}g(x) = \lim_{x\to 1^-}\frac{1}{x-1} = \frac{1}{0^-} = -\infty
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1^+}g(x) = \lim_{x\to 1^-}\frac{1}{x-1} =\frac{1}{0^+} =  -\infty
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>g(x)</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=1</m>,
          despite originally having the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>,
          since we could cancel and arrive at the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a graph of <m>g(x) = \frac{x-1}{(x-1)^2}</m>,

        <p>
          Note that in this example, we originally had the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>,
          but then the limit became of the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> after cancelling,
          so we ended up with an infinite limit.

            f(x) = \frac{2x(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)(x-1)(x+1)}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>f(x)=0</m> when the numerator is equal to 0, provided that <m>f(x)</m> is defined,
          meaning that the denominator is not equal to 0.
          So <m>f(x)=0</m> for <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>,
          but not <m>x=-2</m> since <m>f(-2)</m> is undefined.
          Thus we have <m>x</m>-intercepts for <m>x=0, 2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>f(x)</m> is undefined when the denominator is equal to 0, so when <m>x=-1, 1</m>,
          and <m>2</m>.
          Since the <m>x+2</m> factors will cancel,
          we know that we will have a hole at <m>x=-2</m>.
          Indeed:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to -2}f(x) \amp = \lim_{x\to -2}\frac{2x(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)(x-1)(x+1)}\\ \amp = \lim_{x\to -2}\frac{2x(x-2)}{(x-1)(x+1)}\\ \amp =\frac{2(-2)(-4)}{(-3)(-1)}\\ \amp = \frac{16}{3} \end{aligned}
          </me>
          and so the precise location of the hole is <m>(-2,16/3)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <m>x=\pm1</m>, we have no cancellation,
          and so both limits have the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> and are infinite,
          thus we have vertical asymptotes at <m>x=\pm 1</m>.
          We compute right and left limits separately for <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m>,
          using the simplified form of <m>f(x)</m> and analyzing whether the factors that are <m>0</m> are slightly positive and negative to the left/right.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <m>x=-1</m>, the factor <m>x+1</m> is slightly negative as
          <m>x\to -1^-</m> and slightly positive as <m>x\to -1^+</m>:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to -1^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to -1^-} \frac{2x(x-2)}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \frac{(-2)(-3)}{(-2)(0^-)} = +\infty
          </me>
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to -1^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\to -1^+} \frac{2x(x-2)}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \frac{(-2)(-3)}{(-2)(0^+)} = -\infty
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          At <m>x=1</m>, the factor <m>x-1</m> is slightly negative as
          <m>x\to 1^-</m> and slightly positive as <m>x\to 1^+</m>:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 1^-} \frac{2x(x-2)}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \frac{(2)(-1)}{(0^-)(2)} = +\infty
          </me>
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 1^+} \frac{2x(x-2)}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \frac{(2)(-1)}{(0^+)(2)} = -\infty
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we have
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to-1^-}f(x) = \infty\text{ and }  \lim_{x\to-1^+}f(x) = -\infty
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to1^-}f(x) = \infty\text{ and }  \lim_{x\to1^+}f(x) = -\infty
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To summarize, there are <m>x</m>-intercepts at <m>x=0, 2</m>,
          a hole at <m>x=-2</m>, and vertical asymptotes at <m>x=-1, 1</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Where are the <m>x</m>-intercepts, holes,
          and vertical asymptotes of the function
          <me>
            g(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x^3-2x^2-5x+6}
          </me>,
          given that <m>x^3-2x^2-5x+6=(x-1)(x+2)(x-3)</m>?
          No need to compute precise limits.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms and theorems were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    limits of the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>, the Cancellation Theorem for limits, indeterminate limit forms
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Limits of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> are indeterminate and may be either infinite
      (in which case there is a vertical asymptote)
      or finite
      (in which case there is a hole).
      One way to evaluate limits of the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> is by cancellation.
      After cancelling, we may be able to evaluate the limit
      (either as a number or as an infinite limit of the form <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      Instantaneous velocity is a limit of average velocities,
      and always has the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> before simplifying.
      We can tell quickly from factored formulas for rational functions where they have <m>x</m>-intercepts,
      holes, or vertical asymptotes.
