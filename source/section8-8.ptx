    <title>Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we develop formulas for differentiating the inverse trigonometric functions,
      along with a formula for differentiating any inverse function.
      We begin by developing a formula for the arcsine function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that if <m>y=\sin^{-1} x</m>,
      then for <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq y\leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
      we can write <m>\sin y = x</m>.
      Then we take the derivative of both sides with respect to <m>x</m> and remember that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>,
      so we have to use implicit differentiation/the chain rule on the left-hand side:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}(\sin y) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}(x) \amp  \leftarrow\text{ derivative with respect to } x\\ \cos(y)\cdot\frac{dy}{dx} \amp = 1 \amp  \leftarrow\text{ chain rule on the left-hand side } \\ \frac{dy}{dx} \amp = \frac{1}{\cos y} \amp  \leftarrow\text{ solving for } \frac{dy}{dx} \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      But remember that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>,
      and so we would like to be able to write its derivative
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> as a function of <m>x</m>.
      We substitute <m>y=\sin^{-1}x</m>
      (this is what we started with)
      and remember that we can simplify compositions of trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions as in <xref ref="sec_simplifyingcompositionsoftrigandinversetrig">Section</xref>:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\frac{dy}{dx} \amp = \frac{1}{\cos y} \amp  \\ \amp = \frac{1}{\cos(\sin^{-1} x)} \amp \leftarrow\text{ substituting }  y=\sin^{-1}x\\ \amp = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\amp \leftarrow\text{ simplification from <xref ref="sec_simplifyingcompositionsoftrigandinversetrig">Section</xref> } \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we have shown that
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}(\sin^{-1} x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting fact about the derivative of the arcsine function is that its domain is slightly smaller than the domain of the original arcsine function.
      The graphs of these two functions are below.
      Note that the domain of <m>f(x) = \arcsin x</m> is <m>[-1,1]</m> while the domain of <m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}</m> is <m>(-1,1)</m>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_TaalmanPage441ad">
      <caption>The graph of <m>f(x) = \sin^{-1}x</m> (left; blue) has domain <m>[-1,1]</m> and the graph of <m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}</m> (right; red) has domain <m>(-1,1)</m>.</caption>
      <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage441a.png"/> \qquad<image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage441d.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      If you look closely at the graph of <m>f(x) = \arcsin x</m>,
      you should notice that at the ends of the domain the tangent lines will be vertical
      (the tangent lines at the corresponding points on the graph of <m>y=\sin x</m> are horizontal).
      Since a vertical line has undefined slope,
      the derivative does not exist at these points.
      This means that the derivative of arcsine is not defined at <m>x=1</m> or <m>x=-1</m>.
      This is precisely what we see in the graph of <m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}</m>:
      there is a vertical asymptote at <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=-1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If none of the above made any sense to you, fear not!
      You can still use the formula for the derivative without understanding it.
      The next few examples demonstrate how to take the derivative of functions involving arcsine.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x) = (\sin^{-1}x)^2</m> is a composition of
          <m>(\cdot)^2</m> with the inverse trigonometric function <m>\sin^{-1}x</m> on the inside.
          By the chain rule,
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[(\sin^{-1}x)^2] = 2(\sin^{-1}x)^1\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\right) = \frac{2\sin^{-1}x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}
          </me>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The function <m>g(x) = \sin^{-1}(x^2)</m> is a composition of
          <m>\sin^{-1}(\cdot)</m> with <m>x^2</m> on the inside.
          By the chain rule,
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[(\sin^{-1}(x^2)] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(x^2)^2}}\cdot 2x = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{1-x^4}}

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The function <m>h(x)=x\sin^{-1}(3x+1)</m> is a product of two functions,
          <m>x</m> and <m>\sin^{-1}(3x+1)</m>,
          and thus we begin with the product rule.
          We will also need the chain rule to differentiate the composition <m>\sin^{-1}(3x+1)</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = (1)\cdot \sin^{-1}(3x+1) +x\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(3x+1)^2}}\cdot(3)\\ \amp = \sin^{-1}(3x+1) +\frac{3x}{\sqrt{1-(3x+1)^2}}. \end{aligned}

    <title>Derivatives of Arbitrary Inverse Functions</title>
    <p>
      We could develop formulas for the derivatives of the arccosine and arctangent functions the same way that we developed the above formula for the derivative of arcsine.
      On the other hand,
      it would be nice to develop one general formula for derivatives of any inverse function instead of developing them one by one,
      so we'll do that instead in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose now that <m>f</m> and
      <m>g=f^{-1}</m> are differentiable functions that are inverses of each other.
      Then by definition, <m>y=f(x)</m> if and only if <m>g(y)=x</m> and
      <m>f(g(x)) = x</m> for every <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>g=f^{-1}</m>.
      Taking the derivative of <m>f(g(x)) = x</m>:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] \amp = \frac{d}{dx}[x]\\ f'(g(x))g'(x) \amp = 1\amp \leftarrow\text{ using the chain rule } \\ g'(x) \amp = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))}\amp \leftarrow\text{ solving for } g'(x)\\ (f^{-1})'(x) \amp = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}\amp \leftarrow\text{ recall that \(g = f^{-1}\) and substitute} \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we have found that if we know <m>f(x)</m> has derivative <m>f'(x)</m> and inverse <m>f^{-1}(x)</m>,
      the derivative of the inverse function <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> is
      <me>
        \left[f^{-1}(x)\right]^\prime =(f^{-1})'(x) =  \frac{1}{f'\left(f^{-1}(x)\right)}
      </me>
      meaning the reciprocal of the composition <m>f'\circ f^{-1}</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Another Way to Deduce the Derivative of Arcsine</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Note that this is consistent with our work finding a derivative for <m>f^{-1}(x) = \sin^{-1}x</m>.
          Because <m>f(x) = \sin x</m> has derivative <m>f'(x) = \cos x</m>,
          we found that the derivative of <m>f^{-1}(x) = \sin^{-1}x</m> was
          <me>
            (f^{-1})'(x) =  \frac{1}{f'\left(f^{-1}(x)\right)} = \frac{1}{\cos(\sin^{-1}x)}
          </me>
          before simplifying.
          We <em>also</em> know from <xref ref="sec_simplifyingcompositionsoftrigandinversetrig">Section</xref>
          that <m>\cos(\sin^{-1}x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}</m>, and so
          <me>
            (f^{-1})'(x) =  \frac{1}{f'\left(f^{-1}(x)\right)} = \frac{1}{\cos(\sin^{-1}x)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      <em>Visual Interpretation:</em>
      We can make sense of this formula for the derivative of the inverse visually,
      using what we know about graphs of inverse functions.
      If we graph the function <m>y=f(x)</m> and its inverse <m>y=f^{-1}(x) = g(x)</m>,
      remember that the point <m>(a,b)</m> is on the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> if and only if the point <m>(b,a)</m> is on the graph of <m>y=f^{-1}(x) = g(x)</m>.
      This is because
      <me>
        b=f(a) \Leftrightarrow f^{-1}(b) =a
      </me>.
      We can graph the tangent line to <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m> and when we reflect over the line <m>y=x</m>,
      we should get the tangent line to <m>y=f^{-1}(x)</m> at <m>x=b</m>.
      Take a careful look at the graph in <xref ref="fig_ACFigure2-6-6">Figure</xref>
      below and how it relates to what was just said:
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ACFigure2-6-6">
      <caption>The tangent line to <m>f(x)</m> at <m>(a,b)</m> and the tangent line to <m>g(x) = f^{-1}(x)</m> at <m>(b,a)</m>. Each is the reflection of the other over the line <m>y=x</m>.</caption>
      <image width="46%" source="ACFigure2-6-6.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Since <m>f^{-1}(b)=a</m>,
      the slope on the graph of the tangent line to <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> at <m>x=b</m>
      (light green)
      is given by
      <me>
        (f^{-1})'(b) = \frac{1}{f'\left(f^{-1}(b)\right)} = \frac{1}{f'(a)}
      </me>,
      meaning, it is the <em>reciprocal</em>
      of the slope of the tangent line to <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>
      (dark green).
      In other words,
      flipping the tangent line over the line <m>y=x</m> results in a tangent line with reciprocal slope.

      <xref ref="ex_xcubedinversederivative">Example</xref>
      and <xref ref="ex_expinversederivative">Example</xref>
      demonstrate this reciprocal relationship via the functions
      <m>f(x) = x^3</m> and <m>f(x) = \ln x</m>, respectively.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_xcubedinversederivative">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x) = x^3</m> is one-to-one and has inverse function <m>f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}</m>.
          The point <m>(2,2^3) = (2,8)</m> is on the graph of <m>f(x)</m> while the point
          <m>(8,\sqrt[3]{8}) = (8,2)</m> is on the graph of <m>f^{-1}(x)</m>.
          What we have just found out is that the slope of the tangent line to
          <m>f(x) = x^3</m> at <m>x=2</m> is the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <m>f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}</m> at <m>x=8</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's verify this algebraically.
          First, we know the derivative of
          <m>f(x) = x^3</m> is <m>f'(x) = 3x^2</m>,
          and so <m>f'(2) = 3(2)^2 = 12</m> is the slope of the tangent line to <m>f(x) = x^3</m> at <m>x=2</m>.
          On other other hand,
          the derivative of <m>f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}=x^{1/3}</m> is
          <m>(f^{-1})'(x)= \frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3} = \frac{1}{3(\sqrt[3]{x})^2}</m>,
          and so at <m>x=8</m>,
          the slope of the tangent line to
          <m>f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}</m> is <m>(f^{-1})'(8)=\frac{1}{3(\sqrt[3]{8})^2} = \frac{1}{3(2)^2} = \frac{1}{12}</m>.

          For another example, the function
          <m>f(x) = e^x</m> has inverse <m>f^{-1}(x) = \ln x</m>.
          Recall that <m>f'(x) = e^x</m> is the derivative of <m>e^x</m>.
          Using the formula developed earlier, we see that

          since we know <m>e^{\ln x} = x</m>.
          This is another way of showing that <m>\frac{d}{dx}(\ln x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>.
          <em>Note that mathematics is always consistent with itself;

    <title>Derivatives of Arccosine and Arctangent</title>
    <p>
      Using the formula for the derivative of the inverse of a function from the previous section,
      we can quickly find derivatives for
      <m>y=\cos^{-1}x</m> and <m>y=\tan^{-1}x</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f(x) = \cos x</m> and <m>0\leq x\leq \pi</m>,
          we know that <m>f^{-1}(x) = \cos^{-1}x</m> for <m>-1\leq x\leq 1</m>.
          Recall that <m>f'(x) = -\sin x</m>.
          Then
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[\cos^{-1}(x)] = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))} = \frac{1}{-\sin(\cos^{-1}x)} = \frac{-1}{ \sqrt{1-x^2}}
          </me>
          since <m>\sin(\cos^{-1}x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}</m>.
          To see this,
          let <m>x=\cos \theta</m> be the adjacent side of a triangle with hypotenuse <m>1</m>,

          If <m>f(x) = \tan x</m> and <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\lt x\lt \frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
          we know that <m>f^{-1}(x) = \tan^{-1}x</m> for all real numbers <m>x</m>.
          Recall that <m>f'(x) = \sec^2 x</m>.
          Then
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}[\tan^{-1}(x)] = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))} = \frac{1}{\sec^2(\tan^{-1}x)} = \cos^2(\tan^{-1}x)
          </me>
          since <m>\sec  = \frac{1}{\cos}</m>.
          In order to simplify <m>\cos^2(\tan^{-1}x)</m>,
          let <m>x=\tan \theta</m> so that we have a triangle with opposite side <m>x</m> and adjacent side <m>1</m>:
          <image width="18%" source="arctanx.png"/> Using the Pythagorean Theorem,
          the hypotenuse is <m>\sqrt{1+x^2}</m> and so

            \frac{d}{dx}[\tan^{-1}(x)] = \cos^2(\tan^{-1}x) = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{1+x^2}

      The next three examples demonstrate how to take derivatives of functions involving the arctangent and arccosine functions.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate the derivative of <m>f(x) = \tan^{-1}\sqrt{x}</m>.
          What is the domain of <m>f(x)</m>?
          Of <m>f'(x)</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x) = \tan^{-1}\sqrt{x}</m> is a composition of the arctangent function with <m>\sqrt{x}</m> on the inside.
          By the chain rule,
          <me>
            f'(x)= \frac{1}{1+(\sqrt{x})^2}\cdot \frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{1+x}\cdot \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}(1+x)}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The domain of <m>f(x) = \tan^{-1}\sqrt{x}</m> is <m>x\geq 0</m> since arctangent can take any argument,
          but we need a nonnegative number inside the square root.
        </p>
        <p>
          The domain of <m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}(1+x)}</m> is <m>x>0</m> since we do not want to a denominator of 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>It is also true that the derivative <m>f'(x)</m> is undefined when <m>1+x = 0</m>,
          so when <m>x=-1</m>,
          but this is not in the domain of <m>f(x)</m> so is not relevant.
          The derivative of a function can only be defined on the domain of the function.</em>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate the derivative of <m>g(x) = \dfrac{5}{\cos^{-1}x}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Here, it is especially tempting to try to simplify using the <m>-1</m> as an exponent,
          but in this context,
          the <m>-1</m> superscript indicates the arccosine function,
          not the reciprocal of cosine.
          We can instead rewrite
          <me>
            g(x) = 5(\cos^{-1}x)^{-1}
          </me>
          in order to take the derivative using the chain rule with inside function <m>\cos^{-1}x</m>:
          <me>
            g'(x) = 5(-1)(\cos^{-1}x)^{-2}\cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \frac{5}{(\cos^{-1}x)^2\sqrt{1-x^2}}
          </me>.
          You could also use the quotient rule,
          but the above computation is much quicker.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate the derivative of <m>h(x) = \sin^2(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We'll begin by rewriting the notation <m>\sin^2 u</m> as
          <m>(\sin u)^2</m> so we can see the correct order for the differentiation rules.
          The function <m>h(x)</m> is actually a composition of
          <em>five</em> functions:
          <m>(\cdot)^2, \sin (\cdot), \tan^{-1}(\cdot),
          e^{(\cdot)}</m>, and <m>3x</m>.
          Thus we will have to apply the chain rule several times and will proceed carefully,
          writing several intermediate steps:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sin^2(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\right)\\ \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\left(\sin(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\right)^2\right)\amp \leftarrow\text{ rewrite function } \\ \amp = 2(\sin(\tan^{-1}e^{3x}))^1\frac{d}{dx}(\sin(\tan^{-1}e^{3x}))\amp \leftarrow\text{ chain rule with } (\cdot)^2\\ \amp =2\sin(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\cos(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\frac{d}{dx}(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\amp \leftarrow\text{ chain rule with } \sin (\cdot)\\ \amp =2\sin(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\cos(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\frac{1}{1+(e^{3x})^2}\frac{d}{dx}(e^{3x})\amp \leftarrow\text{ chain rule with } \tan^{-1} (\cdot)\\ \amp =2\sin(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\cos(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\frac{1}{1+(e^{3x})^2}e^{3x}\frac{d}{dx}(3x)\amp \leftarrow\text{ chain rule with } e^{(\cdot)}\\ \amp =2\sin(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\cos(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\frac{1}{1+(e^{3x})^2}e^{3x}(3)\amp \leftarrow\text{ derivative of the innermost function, } 3x\\ \amp =\frac{6e^{3x}\sin(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})\cos(\tan^{-1}e^{3x})}{1+3^{6x}}\amp \leftarrow\text{ simplifying } \end{aligned}

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following formulas were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    Derivatives of arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent. The derivative of an arbitrary inverse function, in terms of the original function.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions are all algebraic functions.
      The slope of the tangent line to <m>f(x)</m> at a point <m>(a,b)</m> is the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line to
      <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> at the point <m>(b,a)</m>.
      The formula for the derivative of an arbitrary inverse function can be applied to find formulas for the derivatives of arcsine,
      arccosine,
      and arctangent, as well as the natural logarithm <m>\ln x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      Compositions of trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions simplify to algebraic expressions.
      You still have to use <em>all</em>
      of the previous derivative rules you have learned so far.
