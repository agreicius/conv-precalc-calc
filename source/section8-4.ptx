          Recall that functions must be one-to-one in order to have an inverse.
          As a result,
          we must restrict the domains of the trigonometric functions in order to define their (partial) inverse functions.

    <title>A Brief Recap of Inverse Functions</title>
    <p>
      Recall from <xref ref="sec_inversefunctions">Section</xref>
      that a function has an inverse only if the function is one-to-one,
      or in other words that it passes the Horizontal Line Test.
      This allows us to "reverse" a function <m>y=f(x)</m> to obtain a function <m>f^{-1}(y) = x</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, if <m>f(x) = x^3</m>,
          then <m>f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt[3]{y}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For another example, if <m>f(x) = e^x</m>,
          then <m>f^{-1}(y) = \ln y</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Given a one-to-one function <m>f(x)</m>,
      its inverse is by definition the function
      <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> with the property that
      <me>
        f^{-1}(f(x)) = x\text{ and }  f(f^{-1}(y)) = y
      </me>
      for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> and for all <m>y</m> in the domain of <m>f^{-1}</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>f(x) = x^3</m>, we have
          <me>
            f^{-1}(f(x)) = \sqrt[3]{x^3} = x,\text{ for all real numbers } x
          </me>
          <me>
            f(f^{-1}(y)) = (\sqrt[3]{y})^3 = y,\text{ for all real numbers } y
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>f(x) = e^x</m>, we have
          <me>
            f^{-1}(f(x)) = \ln(e^x) = x,\text{ for all real numbers } x
          </me>
          <me>
            f(f^{-1}(y)) = e^{\ln y} = y,\text{ for all positive real numbers } y
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      If a function fails to be one-to-one,
      then it does not have an inverse.
      However, we can restrict the domain on which we consider the function in order to make the remaining function one-to-one,
      and define an inverse of the function restricted to that domain.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the function <m>f(x) = x^2+1</m> fails the horizontal line test and therefore is not one-to one on the domain <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.
          But on the restricted domain <m>[0,\infty)</m>,
          the function <m>f(x) = x^2+1</m> is one-to-one,
          as we can see in <xref ref="fig_RestrictedDomain">Figure</xref> below:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_RestrictedDomain">
          <caption>The function <m>f(x) = x^2+1</m> on the <em>restricted</em> domain <m>[0,\infty)</m> is indeed one-to-one.</caption>
          <image width="46%" source="RestrictedDomain.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          From the graph in <xref ref="fig_RestrictedDomain">Figure</xref>
          we also see that the range of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>[1,\infty)</m>.
          This tells us that the domain of <m>f^{-1}</m> is
          <m>[1,\infty)</m> before we do any computations.
        </p>
        <p>
          A formula for the inverse for <m>f</m> can be computed via
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}y \amp = x^2+1\\ y-1 \amp = x^2\\ \pm\sqrt{y-1} \amp = x \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems that we have <em>two</em>
          formulas for <m>f^{-1}</m>,
          consisting of <m>\sqrt{y-1}</m> and <m>-\sqrt{y-1}</m>.
          However, since we have restricted the domain for <m>x</m> to <m>x\geq 0</m>,
          we only want the positive square root and can write
          <me>
            x = f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{y-1}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can verify explicitly that the domain of <m>f^{-1}</m> is the range <m>[1,\infty)</m> of <m>f</m>,
          since we need <m>y-1\geq 0</m> within the square root,
          meaning that <m>y\geq 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's check our work both algebraically and geometrically:
        </p>
        <p>
          We can check that the definition of an inverse function is satisfied by simplifying the compositions
          <m>f\circ f^{-1}</m> and <m>f^{-1}\circ f</m>:
          <me>
            f^{-1}(f(x)) = \sqrt{(x^2+1)-1} = \sqrt{x^2} = x,\text{ for all } x\geq 0
          </me>
          <me>
            f(f^{-1}(y)) = (\sqrt{y-1})^2+1 = (y-1)+1 = y,\text{ for all } y\geq 1
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Visually, we see that the graph of
          <m>f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x-1}</m> is the graph of <m>f(x)</m> reflected over the line <m>y=x</m>:
        </p>

    <p>
      In the rest of this section,
      we discuss inverses of the trigonometric functions.
      There is a rather significant obstacle to this:
      none of them are one-to-one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function <m>y=\sin \theta</m> takes angles as inputs and returns <m>y</m>-coordinates on the unit circle as outputs.
      Is there a way to reverse this function to an inverse function
      <m>\sin^{-1}y = \theta</m> that takes <m>y</m>-coordinates on the unit circle as inputs and returns angles as outputs?
      Not immediately, since <m>\sin \theta</m> is not one-to-one:
      many angles correspond to any given <m>y</m>-coordinate on the unit circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, <em>none</em> of the six trigonometric functions are one-to-one,
      but after restricting domains we can construct the so-called inverse trigonometric functions.
      In this section,
      we will focus on the inverse of only three of the six inverse trigonometric functions: Those for cosine, sine,
      and tangent.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Give three examples of angles <m>\theta</m> for which <m>\sin\theta = 1</m>.
          This shows us that we cannot "reverse" the function sine without restricting its domain.

    <title>The arccosine function</title>
    <p>
      The function cosine repeats itself over and over and over again,
      so there are many different intervals we could use to define an inverse.
      The important part is that we pick one domain and stick to it consistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the plot of the standard cosine function in <xref ref="fig_APCFigure4-3-1">Figure</xref>
      below along with the emphasized portion of the graph on <m>[0,\pi]</m>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_APCFigure4-3-1">
      <caption><m>y = \cos t</m> is one-to-one on the interval <m>[0,\pi]</m>.</caption>
      <image width="84%" source="APCFigure4-3-1.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      If we consider <m>g(t) = \cos t</m> for only <m>0\leq t\leq \pi</m>,
      then the domain of <m>g(t)</m> is the interval <m>[0,\pi]</m>,
      but its range is still <m>[-1,1]</m>,
      the entire range of the cosine function.
      Since <m>g</m> is decreasing on its domain,
      we can see that it passes the Horizontal Line Test.
      Thus <m>g</m> has an inverse function,
      and before computing anything we know that the inverse <m>g^{-1}</m> has domain <m>[-1,1]</m> and range <m>[0,\pi]</m>.
      Note that <m>g</m> is defined in terms of the cosine function,
      but because it has a different domain,
      it is <em>not</em> the cosine function.
      This restricted version of the cosine function has an inverse function,
      which we call the <em>arccosine</em> function.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any real number <m>x</m> that satisfies <m>-1\leq x\leq 1</m>,
          the <em>arccosine of <m>x</m></em>, denoted
          <me>
            \arccos(x) = \cos^{-1}(x)
          </me>
          is the angle <m>\theta</m> satisfying
          <m>0\leq \theta\leq \pi</m> such that <m>\cos(\theta) = x</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Note particularly that the <em>output</em>
      of the arccosine function is an angle.
      In addition, recall that in the context of the unit circle,
      an angle measured in radians and the corresponding arc length along the unit circle are numerically equal.
      This is why we use the "arc" in "arccosine": given a value <m>1\leq x\leq 1</m>,
      the arccosine function produces the corresponding <em>arc</em>
      (measured counterclockwise from <m>(1,0)</m>),
      such that the cosine of that arc is <m>x</m>.

      (in light blue)
      along with the graph of the arccosine function <m>y=\arccos t</m>
      (in dark blue),
      plotted on the same axis.
      (If you ask me,
      the graph of arccosine is not particularly enlightening and not worth remembering,
      but here it is anyway.)

      Just as the natural logarithm function allowed us to rewrite exponential equations in an equivalent way,
      the arccosine function allows us to do likewise for certain angles and cosine outputs.

          For instance,
          saying <m>\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 0</m> is the same as writing <m>\frac{\pi}{2} = \arccos(0)</m>,
          which reads "<m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> is the angle whose cosine is <m>0</m>".

    <title>The arcsine function</title>
    <p>
      We can develop an inverse function for a restricted version of the sine function in a similar way.
      As with the cosine function,
      we need to choose an interval on which the sine function is always increasing or always decreasing in order to have the function pass the Horizontal Line Test.
      The standard choice is the domain <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]</m> on which
      <m>f(t) = \sin t</m> is increasing and attains all of the values in the range of the sine function.
      Thus we consider <m>f(t) = \sin t</m> with domain
      <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]</m> and range <m>[-1,1]</m> and hence define the corresponding arcsine function.
    </p>
    <definition>

        <p>
          For any real number <m>x</m> that satisfies <m>-1\leq x\leq 1</m>,

          We can calculate the exact value of
          <m>\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)</m> using the unit circle.
          First, we translate from inverse trigonometric function to trigonometric function:
          <me>
            \theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \qquad \Longleftrightarrow\qquad \sin\theta = \frac{1}{2}\text{ with }  -\frac{\pi}{2}\leq \theta\leq \frac{\pi}{2}

        </p>
        <p>
          There are infinitely many angles whose sine is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>;
          recall that this means the <m>y</m>-value of the point on the unit circle must be <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.
          Only one of those angles is in the restricted domain <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]</m> shown below:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_TaalmanPage442b">

        </figure>
        <p>
          Either using a labeled picture of the unit circle and finding where sine is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> on this domain,
          or fitting a <m>30-60-90</m> triangle into the picture as shown below,
          we see that the only angle meeting both of these criteria is <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}</m>.

      There are two standard notations for the arcsin function:
      <m>\arcsin t</m> and <m>\sin^{-1} t</m>.
      The latter reminds us that the arcsin function is the inverse of the sine function,
      but we must be careful about how we apply this because of the restriction on the domain of sine.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          we can compute <m>\sin^{-1}\left(\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right) = -\frac{\pi}{4}</m> via the property
          <m>\sin^{-1}(\sin x) = x</m> of inverse functions.
          However, this is only true because
          <m>-\frac{\pi}{4}</m> is within the restricted domain
          <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]</m> used to define the arcsine function.
        </p>
        <p>
          By contrast,
          suppose we wish to simplify <m>\sin^{-1}\left(\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)\right)</m>.
          You may be tempted to say that
          <m>\sin^{-1}\left(\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)\right)</m> is equal to <m>\frac{3\pi}{4}</m>.
          However, <m>\frac{3\pi}{4}</m> is not in the domain of the restricted sine function.
          We must calculate <m>\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)</m> and then evaluate the inverse sine function at that value (or otherwise translate the angle
          <m>\frac{3\pi}{4}</m> to the correct angle between
          <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
          We know that <m>\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}</m>,
          as shown next at the left.
          To find the value of <m>\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)</m>,
          we must find the angle in <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]</m> whose sine is <m>\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}</m>.
          This angle is <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m>, as shown at the right.

        <p>
          Therefore <m>\sin^{-1}\left(\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)\right) =\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)= \frac{\pi}{4}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternately,
          it is completely accurate to use our knowledge of the unit-circle definition of sine as the <m>y</m>-coordinate on the unit circle to say that we would like the angle between <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and
          <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> with the same <m>y</m>-coordinate.
          For this example,
          we must simply reflect the point on the unit circle over the <m>y</m>-axis,
          and determine that the appropriate angle at that point is <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m>.
          Use whatever form of this intuition you prefer.
          In either case, I recommend drawing a quick picture of the unit circle to help your reasoning.

    <title>The arctangent function</title>
    <p>
      Finally, we develop an inverse function for a restricted version of the tangent function.
      We choose the domain <m>\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> on which
      <m>y=\tan t</m> is increasing and attains all of the values in the range
      <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> of the tangent function.

    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> The graph of

      This is also the most useful of all of the inverse trigonometric functions,
      the reason for which you will learn later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the range of the tangent function is <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>,
      this is the domain of the arctangent function.
      Likewise the range of the arctangent function is the restricted domain
      <m>\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> on which the tangent function is one-to-one.

            \arctan(x) = \tan^{-1}(x)
          </me>
          is the angle <m>\theta</m> satisfying
          <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\lt  \theta\lt  \frac{\pi}{2}</m> such that <m>\tan(\theta) = x</m>.

      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's calculate the value of
          <m>\arctan(-\sqrt{3}) = \tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3})</m> using the unit circle.
          Translating to the tangent function, we need:
          <me>
            \theta = \tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3}) \qquad \Longleftrightarrow\qquad \tan\theta =-\sqrt{3}\text{ with }  -\frac{\pi}{2}\lt  \theta\lt  \frac{\pi}{2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of sine and cosine, this means that
          <me>
            \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} = -\sqrt{3} \qquad \Longleftrightarrow\qquad \sin\theta = -\sqrt{3}\cos\theta
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We now have to think of an angle <m>\theta</m> in the first or fourth quadrant of the unit circle whose sine is <m>-\sqrt{3}</m> times its cosine.
          Since <m>\tan^{-1} x</m> is a function,
          there must be only one such angle;
          we will try to "guess" it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>\tan\theta</m> is negative,
          the angle <m>\theta</m> must be in the fourth quadrant.
          Since only <m>30-60-90</m> triangles involve <m>\sqrt{3}</m>,
          we must have one as our reference triangle.
          Lastly, with a little guess-and-check,
          we can determine that the triangle must be in the position shown to the right of <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage442d">Figure</xref>.
          From this, we conclude that the angle must be <m>-\frac{\pi}{3}</m>.
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_TaalmanPage442d">
          <caption>In order to have <m>\tan\theta = -\sqrt{3}</m>, we must have a <m>30-60-90</m> reference triangle, with terminal angle <m>-\frac{\pi}{3}</m>.</caption>

        </figure>
        <p>
          Thus we have now shown that <m>\tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3}) = -\frac{\pi}{3}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that it is <em>not correct</em>
          to say <m>\tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3}) = \frac{2\pi}{3}</m>,
          even though <m>\tan\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = -\sqrt{3}</m>,
          since we have specifically defined the range of the arctangent function to be <m>\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m>.
          Thus any angle that we get as an output from <m>\tan^{-1}</m> must be between
          <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, it is <em>not correct</em>
          to say that <m>\tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3}) = \frac{5\pi}{3}</m>,
          even though <m>\frac{5\pi}{3}</m> and
          <m>-\frac{\pi}{3}</m> intersect the unit circle at the same point.
          Again, the function arctangent is specifically defined so that we are using only the angles between
          <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.

      The following functions were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    The arccosine function: <m>\arccos x = \cos^{-1}</m>, the arcsine function: <m>\arcsin x = \sin^{-1}x</m>, and the arctangent function: <m>\arctan x = \tan^{-1}x</m>.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Each of the inverse trigonometric functions arises from taking a restricted domain of the corresponding trigonometric function on which the latter is one-to-one.
      Take particular care that the output of any inverse trigonometric function is within these restricted intervals.
      Inverse functions "reverse" the original function,
      but in this case we only have "partial" inverse functions,
      so it's more complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      The notation <m>f^{-1}</m> does NOT mean <m>\frac{1}{f}</m>.
