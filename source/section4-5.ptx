    <title>Derivatives Do NOT Distribute Over Products and Quotients</title>
    <p>
      As mentioned in the previous section,
      the following are <sc>NOT</sc> valid rules for taking derivatives:
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)\cdot g(x)\right] = \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]\cdot\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)]
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] = \frac{\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]}{\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)]}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are two basic examples illustrating why:
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Non-example: The Derivative Does NOT Distribute Over a Product</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can calculate the derivative of <m>x^2\cdot x^3</m> by simplifying:
          <me>
            x^2\cdot x^3 = x^5
          </me>
          and then taking the derivative:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}(x^2\cdot x^3) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^5) = 5x^4
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if we try to multiply the derivatives
          <m>\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2</m>, we get
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}(x^2)\cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = (2x)\cdot (3x^2) = 6x^3
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we can clearly see that
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}(x^2\cdot x^3) \neq \frac{d}{dx}(x^2)\cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x^3)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <title>Non-example: The Derivative Does NOT Distribute Over a Quotient</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Similarly, we can calculate the derivative of
          <m>\dfrac{x^3}{x^2}</m> by simplifying first:
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{x^3}{x^2}\right) = \frac{d}{dx}(x) = 1
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if we try to make a quotient from the derivatives
          <m>\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2</m>, we get
          <me>
            \frac{\frac{d}{dx}(x^3)}{\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) } = \frac{3x^2}{2x} = \frac{3x}{2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we can clearly see that
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{x^3}{x^2}\right)\neq \frac{\frac{d}{dx}(x^3)}{\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) }
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the functions <m>f(x) = x^2+1</m> and <m>g(x) = x^3</m>.

      How exactly, then,
      are we supposed to take derivatives of product and quotients without simplifying first?

  <subsection xml:id="sec_productruleincontext">
    <title>Real-World Motivation for the Derivative of a Product</title>
    <p>
      Say that an investor is regularly purchasing stock in a particular company.
      Let <m>N(t)</m> represent the number of shares owned on day <m>t</m>,
      where <m>t=0</m> represents the first day on which shares were purchased.
      Let <m>S(t)</m> give the value of one share of the stock on day <m>t</m>;
      note that the units on <m>S(t)</m> are dollars per share.
      To compute the total value of the stock on day <m>t</m>,
      we take the product
      <me>
        V(t) \text{ dollars }  = N(t)\cdot S(t) \text{ (shares)\(\cdot\) (dollars per share). }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that over time,
      both the number of shares and the value of a given share will vary.
      The derivative <m>N\,'(t)</m> measures the rate at which the number of shares is changing,
      while <m>S\,'(t)</m> measures the rate at which the value per share is changing.
      How do these respective rates of change affect the rate of change of the total value function?
    </p>
    <p>
      To help us understand the relationship among changes in <m>N,S</m>,
      and <m>V</m>,
      let's consider some specific data.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose that on day 100,
            the investor owns 520 shares of stock and the stock's current value is $27.50 per share.
            This tells us that <m>N(100) = 520</m> and <m>S(100) = 27.50</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            On day 100, the investor purchases an additional 12 shares
            (so the number of shares held is rising at a rate of 12 shares per day).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            On that same day the price of the stock is rising at a rate of 0.75 dollars per share per day.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In calculus notation,
      the latter two facts tell us that <m>N\,'(100)=12</m>
      (shares per day)
      and <m>S\,'(100)=0.75</m>
      (dollars per share per day).
      At what rate is the value of the investor's total holdings changing on day 100?
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the increase in total value comes from two sources:
      the growing number of shares,
      and the rising value of each share.
      If only the number of shares is increasing
      (and the value of each share is constant),
      the rate at which which total value would rise is the product of the current value of the shares and the rate at which the number of shares is changing.
      That is, the rate at which total value would change is given by
      <me>
        S(100)\cdot N\,'(100) = 27.50 \frac{\text{ dollars } }{\text{ share } }\cdot 12\frac{\text{ shares } }{\text{ day } } = 330\frac{\text{ dollars } }{\text{ day } }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note particularly how the units make sense and show the rate at which the total value <m>V</m> is changing,
      measured in dollars per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      If instead the number of shares is constant,
      but the value of each share is rising,
      the rate at which the total value would rise is the product of the number of shares and the rate of change of share value.
      The total value is rising at a rate of
      <me>
        N(100)\cdot S\,'(100) = 520\text{ shares } \cdot 0.75\frac{\text{ dollars per share } }{\text{ day } } = 390\frac{\text{ dollars } }{\text{ day } }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, when both the number of shares and the value of each share are changing,
      we have to include both of these sources.
      In that case, the rate at which the total value is rising is
      <me>
        V\,'(100) = S(100)\cdot N\,'(100)+N(100)\cdot S\,'(100) =330+390=720\frac{\text{ dollars } }{\text{ day } }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We expect the total value of the investor's holdings to rise by about $720 on the 100th day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key observation is the following formula,
      which we will soon learn is called the Product Rule:
      <me>
        V\,' = \frac{d}{dt}\left[N\cdot S\right] = S\cdot N\,'+N\cdot S\,'
      </me>
    </p>

    <title>The Product Rule</title>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_productrule">
      <title>Derivatives of Products of Functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are functions,
          then for all <m>x</m> where the functions involved are differentiable,
          <me>
            <md>
              \textrm{\textbf{Product Rule:}} \amp \qquad \frac{d}{dx}(f(x)g(x))=f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)
            </md>
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Some people remember the product rule by remembering the pattern of differentiating one piece and not the other in both possible ways and then adding them;
      there is one derivative and one original function in each term
      (this generalizes to products of more than two functions;
      we'll play with that in class later).
    </p>
    <p>
      You will have to practice the product rule enough that it becomes automatic,
      because it will be needed often throughout the rest of the course.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, with our earlier example of
          <m>f(x) = x^2+1</m> and <m>g(x) = x^3</m>,
          we can differentiate <m>f(x)g(x)</m> without multiplying it out first:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)g(x)) \amp = f'(x) g(x)+f(x) g'(x) \amp   \leftarrow\text{ product rule } \\ \amp = (2x)(x^3) +(x^2+1)(3x^2)\amp   \leftarrow f'(x) = 2x, \text{ and } g(x)=3x^2\\ \amp = 2x^4+3x^4+3x^2 \amp   \leftarrow\text{ algebra } \\ \amp = 5x^4+3x^2 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is exactly what you should have found earlier by multiplying out
          <m>f(x)g(x)</m> first and then taking the derivative.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The rest of this subsection attempts to provide sufficient examples for you to begin to understand the product rule.
      Approach these examples with patience.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the derivative of <m>h(x) = (3x+1)(2-7x)</m> two ways:

            <li>
              <p>
                using the product rule
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>

          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the product rule, we need to know that
          <m>\frac{d}{dx}(3x+1) = 3</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx}(2-7x) = -7</m> so that
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = f'(x) g(x)+f(x) g'(x) \amp   \leftarrow\text{ product rule } \\ \amp = (3)(2-7x)+(3x+1)(-7)\amp   \leftarrow \frac{d}{dx}(3x+1) = 3, \text{ and } \frac{d}{dx}(2-7x) = -7\\ \amp = 6-21x-21x-7 \amp   \leftarrow\text{ algebra } \\ \amp = -42x-1 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Simplifying first,
          <me>
            h(x) = 6x-21x^2+2-7x = -21x^2-x+2
          </me>
          which has derivative
          <me>
            h'(x) = -21(2x)-1 = -42x-1

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the derivative of <m>q(t)\cdot r(t)</m> given that
          <m>q(t) = 4t^3-2t^7+5</m> and <m>r(t) = \frac{1}{t^3}+ \frac{1}{t}-15</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          While we <em>could</em> simplify the product
          <m>q(t)\cdot r(t)</m>, it would be a headache.
          Instead, we compute the derivative via the product rule.
          First, we calculate the individual derivatives:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}q'(t) \amp = 12t^2-14t^6\\ r'(t) \amp = -\frac{3}{t^4}-\frac{1}{t^2} \end{aligned}
          </me>
          so that we can plug them into the product rule:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dx}[q(t)\cdot r(t)]\amp = q'(t) r(t)+q(t) r'(t)\\ \amp = (12t^2-14t^6)\left( \frac{1}{t^3}+ \frac{1}{t}-15\right)+(4t^3-2t^7+5)\left(-\frac{3}{t^4}-\frac{1}{t^2}\right) \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not attempt to simplify this last expression.
          WeBWorK will accept it as it is.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      We can even take derivatives of functions without having an explicit formula,
      provided that we know a few appropriate values:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>h(x) = \sqrt{x}\ g(x)</m> and we know that
          <m>g(4) = 7</m> and <m>g'(4) = 3</m>,
          we can still find <m>h'(4)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applying the product rule, we get
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\left[\sqrt{x}\ g(x)\right]\\ \amp = \frac{d}{dx}\left[\sqrt{x}\right]\cdot g(x)+ \sqrt{x}\cdot \frac{d}{dx}\left[g(x)\right]\\ \amp =\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}\cdot g(x)+\sqrt{x}\cdot g'(x)\\ \amp = \frac{g(x)}{2\sqrt{x}}+\sqrt{x}\ g'(x) \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can evaluate at <m>x=4</m>:
          <me>
            h'(4) = \frac{g(4)}{2\sqrt{4}}+\sqrt{4}\ g'(4) = \frac{7}{2(2)}+2(3) = \frac{7}{4}+6 = \frac{31}{4}

          Thus we will need the values <m>f(1), g(1), f'(1)</m>,
          and <m>g'(1)</m> from the graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the graph of <m>y=f(t)</m>,
          we can see that <m>f(1) = 0</m>.
          On the graph of <m>y=g(t)</m>,
          we cannot see the value of <m>g(1)</m> without determining the equation of the line segment containing <m>x=1</m>.
          The slope looks to be <m>\frac{\text{ rise } }{\text{ run } } = \frac{2}{3/2} = \frac{4}{3}</m> and we can see that the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>0</m>,
          so that <m>g(t) = \frac{4}{3}x</m>.
          Thus <m>g(1) = \frac{4}{3}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>f(t)</m> and <m>g(t)</m> are piecewise-linear functions,
          their derivatives at any point is given by the slope of the line segment at that point.
          On the graph of <m>y=f(t)</m>,
          the slope of the line segment containing <m>x=1</m> looks to be <m>\frac{\text{ rise } }{\text{ run } } = \frac{1}{3/2} = \frac{2}{3}</m>.
          Thus <m>f'(1) = \frac{2}{3}</m>.
          On the graph of <m>y=g(t)</m>,
          we already observed that the slope of the line segment containing <m>x=1</m> looks to be <m>\frac{4}{3}</m>.
          Thus <m>g'(1) = \frac{4}{3}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting these values together, we have
          <me>
            h'(1) = f'(1)g(1)+f(1)g'(1) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)+(0)\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{9}

    <title>The Quotient Rule</title>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_quotientrule">
      <title>Derivatives of Quotients of Functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are functions,
          then for all <m>x</m> where the functions involved are differentiable,
          <me>
            <md>
              \textrm{\textbf{Quotient Rule:}} \amp \qquad  \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right)=\frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{(g(x))^2}
            </md>
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Some people remember the quotient rule with a phrase like,
    </p>
    <em>lo d-hi minus hi d-lo, square the bottom down below</em>
    <p>
      where the "lo" function is the one in the denominator,
      the "hi" function is the one in the numerator,
      and the "d" means to take the derivative.<fn>
      I (Dr.
      Goldstein) have known this formula for over 20 years and still cannot use it reliably without this mnemonic.
      You'll see me get it wrong at least once,
      so please always be on your guard and catch my mistakes!
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to the product rule,
      you will have to practice the quotient rule enough that it becomes automatic,
      because it will be needed often throughout the rest of the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, the rest of this subsection attempts to provide sufficient examples for you to begin to understand the quotient rule.
      This rule takes lots of practice to get the hang of.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x)=x^2+1</m> and <m>g(x)=x^3</m>.
          Find the derivative of the quotient <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Using the quotient rule, we find
          <me>
            <md>
              \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right)\amp =\frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{(g(x))^2}\\ \amp =\frac{(2x)(x^3)-(x^2+1)(3x^2)}{(x^3)^2}\\ \amp =\frac{2x^4-(3x^4+3x^2)}{x^6}\\ \amp =\frac{-x^4-3x^2}{x^6}\\ \amp =\frac{x^2(-x^2-3)}{x^6}\\ \amp =\frac{-x^2-3}{x^4.}
            </md>
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Note that in the last example,
      <me>
        \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{x^2+1}{x^3}  = \frac{x^2}{x^3}+\frac{1}{x^3} = x^{-1}+x^{-3}
      </me>
      and it is much easier to take the derivative of this:
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] = -x^{-2}-3x^{-4}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want, we could consolidate this into a single fraction without any negative exponents,
      and thereby get the same expression,
      <m>\frac{-x^2-3}{x^4}</m>, as at the end of the last example.
      (It's very much up to opinion which of these expressions is the "simplest." Both are correct and are expressed concisely.)
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the derivative of <m>h(x) = \dfrac{x^7+\sqrt{x}}{x^3}</m> two ways:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                using the quotient rule
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                by simplifying first
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the quotient rule,
          we need to know that <m>\frac{d}{dx}(x^7+\sqrt{x}) = 7x^6+\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx} (x^3)= 3x^2</m> so that
          <me>
            h'(x) = \frac{(x^3)\cdot \left(7x^6+\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}\right) - \left(x^7+\sqrt{x}\right)\cdot (3x^2)}{(x^3)^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a bit of a mess,
          but we can simplify it by first distributing and combining like terms in the numerator,
          then distributing the denominator and simplifying powers of <m>x</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = \frac{7x^9+\frac{1}{2}x^{5/2} - 3x^9-3x^{5/2}}{x^6}\\ \amp = \frac{4x^9-\frac{5}{2}x^{5/2}}{x^6}\\ \amp =\frac{4x^9}{x^6}-\frac{\frac{5}{2}x^{5/2}}{x^6}\\ \amp = 4x^3 - \frac{5}{2}x^{-7/2} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let's simplify <m>h(x)</m> first:
          <me>
            h(x) = \frac{x^7+\sqrt{x}}{x^3} = \frac{x^7}{x^3}+\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x^3} = x^4+x^{-5/2}
          </me>
          and thus the derivative is
          <me>
            h'(x) = 4x^3-\frac{5}{2}x^{-7/2}
          </me>
          as we found before.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Be very careful with the fractions in the exponents!</em>

        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> no matter what method you choose to differentiate,
          you should get the same derivative.
          But, as always is true in math,
          there are many different ways to solve the same problem!
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      We can see in all of the examples above that it is much easier to avoid using the quotient rule whenever possible.
      Thus: always try simplifying with algebra before taking the derivative!
      However, sometimes using the quotient rule is unavoidable:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>y=\dfrac{x^2+x-2}{x^3+6}</m>.
          There is no algebra that will make this expression simpler in order to make taking the derivative easier.
          Thus using the quotient rule, we have
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}y' \amp = \frac{(x^3+6)\frac{d}{dx}(x^2+x-2) - (x^2+x-2)\frac{d}{dx}(x^3+6)}{(x^3+6)^2}\\ \amp =\frac{(x^3+6)(2x+1) - (x^2+x-2)(3x^2)}{(x^3+6)^2}\\ \amp = \frac{(2x^4+x^3+12x+6)-(3x^4+3x^3-6x^2)}{(x^3+6)^2}\\ \amp = \frac{-x^4-2x^3+6x^2+12x+6}{(x^3+6)^2} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that there was no use in simplifying the denominator of the above fraction.
          It is simpler left factored.

    <title>The Proof of the Product Rule</title>
    <p>
      The proof of the product rule is interesting enough to include,
      though you will not need to do any calculations like it;
      feel free to skip it if you are running short on time or attention.
      The proof uses the definition of the derivative with a small "trick" of adding a fancy "0" in the numerator.
      In the next section,
      we will prove the quotient rule once we have learned the chain rule.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable functions (meaning that the derivatives <m>f'</m> and <m>g'</m> exist.
        We wish to show that <m>(fg)' = f'g+fg'</m>.
        We will apply the definition of the derivative to the left side of that equation and then use a long string of algebra and limit rules to rewrite it in terms of <m>f', g, f</m>,
        and <m>g'</m>.
        This will be made possible in the second step of the following calculating by adding and subtracting the same expression,
        <me>
          f(x)g(x+h)
        </me>
        from the numerator, effectively adding an overly-complicated 0.
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}(fg)' \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h)+f(x)g(x)}{h} \\ \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h)-f(x)g(x+h)+f(x)g(x+h)+f(x)g(x)}{h} \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice in the middle of the numerator,
        we have inserted <m>-f(x)g(x+h)+f(x)g(x+h)</m>, which is equal to 0.
        This allows us in the next step to factor <m>g(x+h)</m> from the first two terms and <m>f(x)</m> from the third and fourth terms.
        Then we split up the fractions slightly using algebra and distribute the limits,
        using limit rules.

          \begin{aligned}(fg)' \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\Big(f(x+h)-f(x)\Big)\cdot g(x+h)+f(x)\cdot\Big(g(x+h)+g(x)\Big)}{h} \\ \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\left(\frac{\Big(f(x+h)-f(x)\Big)\cdot g(x+h)}{h}+\frac{f(x)\cdot\Big(g(x+h)+g(x)\Big)}{h} \right)\\ \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\left(\frac{\Big(f(x+h)-f(x)\Big)}{h}\cdot g(x+h)+f(x)\cdot\frac{\Big(g(x+h)+g(x)\Big)}{h} \right)\\ \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\left(\frac{\Big(f(x+h)-f(x)\Big)}{h}\right)\cdot\lim_{h\to 0}g(x+h)+ \lim_{h\to 0}f(x)\cdot \lim_{h\to 0}\left(\frac{\Big(g(x+h)+g(x)\Big)}{h} \right)\\ \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\left(\frac{\Big(f(x+h)-f(x)\Big)}{h}\right)\cdot g(x)+f(x)\cdot \lim_{h\to 0}\left(\frac{\Big(g(x+h)+g(x)\Big)}{h} \right) \end{aligned}

        In this last step,
        we have used the fact that <m>g(x)</m> must be continuous,
        since it is differentiable,
        so the limit at <m>h=0</m> of <m>g(x+h)</m> is the value <m>g(x+0) = g(x)</m>.
        Now we recognize the derivative of <m>f</m> at the beginning of the first term,
        and the derivative of <m>g</m> a the end of the second term.
        At last, this is equal to
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}(fg)'  = f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x) \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that throughout the entire calculation,
        our goal was to extract the expressions that represent the derivatives of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
        The algebra steps were not meant to "simplify"; they were meant to get us closer to the final form of <m>f'g+fg'</m>.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following formulas were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    The Product Rule, the Quotient Rule.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Derivatives do NOT distribute over products and quotients.
      In order to take the derivative of two functions that are multiplied together,
      you need to use the product rule.
      In order to take the derivative of a fraction of functions,
      you need to use the quotient rule.
      Both require a LOT of practice in order to do them correctly and quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      Derivatives are instantaneous rates of change and have units of output units per input unit.
      Derivatives are also slopes of tangent lines.
      Functions are increasing when their derivatives are positive and are decreasing when their derivatives are negative.
      The local linearization, a.k.a. the equation of the tangent line,
      can be used to estimate the value of a function near the point of tangency.
