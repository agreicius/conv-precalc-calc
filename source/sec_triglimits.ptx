    <title>Continuity of Trigonometric Functions</title>
    <p>
      As usual, our first steps in learning to calculate limits of a new type of function is to determine when a function is continuous,
      so that taking a limit is the same as evaluating the function.
      Fortunately,
      as with all the previous types of functions we have studied,
      limits of trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions are equal to their values everywhere that they happen to be defined:
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_contoftrigfuncs">
      <title>Continuity of Trigonometric and Inverse Trigonometric Functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          All six trigonometric functions (sine,
          cosine, tangent, cosecant,
          secant, and cotangent) are continuous on their domains.
          Additionally,
          the three inverse trigonometric functions (arcsine,
          arccosine, and arctangent) are continuous on their domains.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This continuity property means that we can calculate limits of trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions by evaluation as long as we are approaching domain values.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, <m>\cos x</m> is defined at <m>x=\pi</m>,
          and this theorem says that the limit
          <m>\ds\lim_{x\to\pi}\cos x</m> is equal to the value <m>\cos(\pi) = -1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For another example,
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1}\tan^{-1}x = \tan^{-1} 1  = \frac{\pi}{4}
          </me>
          since.
        </p>
        <p>
          As another example,
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 1^-} \sin^{-1}x = \sin^{-1} 1 = \frac{\pi}{2}
          </me>
          since <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> is the unique angle in <m>\left[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right]</m> whose sine is 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also verify these answers with the graphs of the inverse tangent and inverse sine functions as seen in <xref ref="fig_Section10-1Pic1-2">Figure</xref>.

          Be as specific as possible,

        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Of course, we can still use the limit rules about combinations of continuous functions
      (<xref ref="thm_limitrules">Theorem</xref>)
      in order to calculate more complicated limits involving trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to 0}\sqrt{\sin \left(x+\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}
          </me>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) = \sqrt{\sin \left(x+\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}</m> is a combination of functions that are continuous on their domains,
          and thus is continuous on its domain.
          Since <m>x=0</m> is in the domain of <m>f</m>,
          we can solve this limit by simple evaluation:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to 0}\sqrt{\sin \left(x+\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}  \amp = \sqrt{\sin \left(0+\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \\ \amp =\sqrt{\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \\ \amp =\sqrt{1} =  1. \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to -1^+}\frac{\sin^{-1}x}{\tan^{-1}x}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Both <m>\sin^{-1}x</m> and
          <m>\tan^{-1}x</m> are defined to the right of and at the point <m>x=-1</m>,
          so we can solve this limit by evaluation.
          We have <m>\sin^{-1}(-1)  = -\frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
          since <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m> is the unique angle in
          <m>\left[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right]</m> whose sine is <m>-1</m>.
          We also have <m>\tan^{-1}(-1)  = -\frac{\pi}{4}</m>,
          since <m>-\frac{\pi}{4}</m> is the unique angle in
          <m>\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> whose tangent is <m>-1</m>.
          Therefore
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to -1^+} \frac{\sin^{-1}x}{\tan^{-1}x} = \frac{-\pi/2}{-\pi/4} = 2

          Here, we will calculate

            \lim_{x\to -\pi}\csc x
          </me>
          without relying on the graph of the function in order to verify that the limit has the behavior suggested by the graph.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since <m>\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}</m> and <m>\sin(-\pi)=0</m>,
          <m>\ds\lim_{x\to -\pi}\csc x</m> is of the form
          <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> and therefore the function
          <m>y=\csc x</m> will have a vertical asymptote at <m>x=-\pi</m>.
          However, we don't yet know if the function approaches <m>-\infty</m> or <m>\infty</m> from the left and the righta.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the left, as <m>x\to-\pi^-</m>,
          we are considering angles slightly less than <m>-\pi</m>;
          these angles terminate in the second quadrant just above the negative horizontal-axis
          (for instance, <m>-\pi-0.1</m>).
          For such angles, the sine function is positive,
          and therefore as <m>x\to-\pi^-</m>,
          we have <m>\sin x\to 0^+</m> and thus
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to -\pi^-}\csc x =\frac{1}{0^+} =  \infty
          </me>.
          Similarly, from the right,
          as <m>x\to -\pi^+</m>, we have <m>\sin x\to 0^-</m>
          (these angles terminate in the third quadrant just below the negative horizontal-axis)
          and thus
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to -\pi^+}\csc x =\frac{1}{0^-} =  -\infty
          </me>.
          This means that <m>\lim_{x\to -\pi}\csc x</m> does not exist,
          and we have verified that <m>\csc x</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=-\pi</m> which approaches <m>\infty</m> to the left and <m>-\infty</m> to the right.

      Note that the graphs of sine and cosine <em>oscillate</em>
      between the values <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>,
      meaning that they repeat all of the values between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m> over and over again.
      Additionally,
      the values of these two functions are never smaller than <m>-1</m> and never greater than <m>1</m>,
      meaning they are <em>bounded</em>
      between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>.
      Both of these behaviors lead to functions with different behavior from anything we have seen before,
      as illustrated in the next example.

              <p>
                As <m>x\to\infty</m>,
                <m>\sin x</m> oscillates between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>.
                Your first thought might be that since <m>x</m> is approaching <m>\infty</m>,
                the function <m>x\sin x</m> will also approach infinity.
                However, because <m>\sin x</m> oscillates between negative and positive numbers,
                so will the function <m>x\sin x</m>.
                Note that as <m>x</m> increases in magnitude, so does <m>x\sin x</m>.
                Therefore as <m>x\to \infty</m>,
                the quantity <m>x\sin x</m> oscillates without converging to any real number,
                and therefore <m>\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}x \sin x</m> does not exist.
                The right side of the graph of
                <m>y=x\sin x</m> is shown in the graph below:
                <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage430a.png"/> Since simply saying that "<m>\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}x \sin x</m> does not exist" is not at all satisfying or complete,
                how should we give an answer for this limit that accurately captures the behavior of the function?
                One way to express this is that <m>x\sin x</m> "oscillates with increasing magnitude and without bound" as <m>x\to\infty</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Again, as <m>x\to \infty</m>,
                <m>\sin x</m> oscillates between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>.
                Therefore the numerator <m>\sin x</m> stays bounded
                (meaning it never becomes infinitely large)
                while the denominator <m>x</m> becomes infinitely large.
                A bounded quantity divided by an infinite quantity that increases without bound is zero;
                in other words, loosely speaking,
                <me>
                  \frac{\text{ bounded } }{\infty}\to 0
                </me>.
                Therefore <m>\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\sin x}{x} = 0</m>.
                The right side of the graph of
                <m>y=\frac{\sin x}{x}</m> is shown in the graph below:
                <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage430b.png"/> Note that
                <m>\frac{\sin x}{x}</m> does indeed have a horizontal asymptote of <m>y=0</m> as <m>x\to \infty</m>,
                even though the graph continues to cross the line <m>y=0</m>
                (and will do so forever,

      None of arcsine,
      arccosine, and arctangent have vertical asymptotes.
      Additionally,
      since arcsine and arccosine have domains <m>[-1,1]</m>,
      neither has a limit as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>.
      However, arctangent has domain
      <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> so we can explore the behavior of this function as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The graph of arctangent is the reflection over the line <m>y=x</m> of the graph of the part of tangent restricted to the domain of <m>\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m>.
      Because of this,
      the vertical asymptotes of the graph of tangent become horizontal asymptotes on the graph of arctangent.

      From this we have the following theorem:

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    Oscillate, bounded
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions are continuous on their domains.
      Tangent, secant, cosecant,
      and cotangent have vertical asymptotes where their denominators are equal to zero.
      All six trigonometric functions do not have limits at infinity,
      though sine and cosine are bounded between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>.
      Arctangent has horizontal asymptotes to <m>y=\pi/2</m> to the right and <m>-\pi/2</m> to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      In order to calculate limits involving trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric,
      start as usual by evaluating.
      If the expression is undefined,
      determine the value of the limit based on the limit form.
