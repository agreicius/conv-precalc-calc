    <title>Recap of Curve Sketch Analyses</title>
    <p>
      Congratulations!
      You have learned all of the differential calculus content of a standard Calculus 1 course!
      In order to bring together all of this knowledge,
      we revisit the idea of sketching the graph of a function by hand,
      with minimal
      (if any)
      help from computational devices.
      We focus particularly on sketching functions that involve the transcendental functions covered this semester:
      exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions,
      as well as a particularly interesting algebraic function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that every graph is made up of pieces that are either linear or one of the four following curves,
      which we can use to "connect the dots" between critical points,
      asymptotes, or other discontinuities.

      Below is the summary of the steps involved in a complete sketch of a function <m>f(x)</m>,
      initially provided in <xref ref="sec_curvesketchingwithasymptotes">Section</xref>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find the <em>domain</em> of <m>f</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine the <em><m>\mathbf{y}</m>-intercept</em>,
            meaning the point <m>(0,f(0))</m>,
            if <m>f(0)</m> is defined.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine any <em><m>\mathbf{x}</m>-intercepts</em> that we can find easily
            (via factoring;
            many times this is not possible without more advanced methods).
            If we are able to find the <m>x</m>-intercepts,
            determine the <em>intervals on which <m>f</m> is positive or negative</em>.
            Record this information on a sign chart for <m>f</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check for any <em>even or odd symmetry</em>,
            specifically whether <m>f(-x)=f(x)</m> (even) or <m>f(-x) = -f(x)</m>
            (odd).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For any points where the function is discontinuous,
            determine the behavior of the function,
            meaning the limits as <m>x\to c</m> for any value <m>x=c</m> not in the domain of the function.
            Make note of any <em>holes or vertical asymptotes</em>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine the "end behavior" of the graph,
            meaning the limits as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>.
            Make note of any <em>left and/or right horizontal asymptotes</em>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Compute <m>f'</m> and determine the points where <m>f'</m> is zero or does not exist.
            Each of these points that is in the domain of <m>f</m> is a <em>critical point</em>
            of <m>f</m> and therefore a possible local extremum of <m>f</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine the intervals on which <m>f'</m> is positive or negative.
            These are the same as the intervals on which <m>f</m> is
            <em>increasing or decreasing</em>, respectively.
            Record this information on a sign chart for <m>f'</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine whether <m>f</m> has a <em>local minimum,
            local maximum, or neither</em> at each critical point.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Compute <m>f''</m> and determine the points where <m>f''</m> is zero or does not exist.
            Each of these points that is in the domain of <m>f</m> is a critical point of <m>f'</m> and therefore a possible
            <em>inflection point</em> of <m>f</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine the intervals on which <m>f''</m> is positive or negative.
            These are the same as the intervals on which <m>f</m> is
            <em>concave up or concave down</em>, respectively.
            Record this information on a sign chart for <m>f''</m>.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine whether or not each critical point of <m>f'</m> is an inflection point of <m>f</m>.

            Draw dashed vertical or horizontal lines for any vertical or horizontal asymptotes of <m>f</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            At each local extremum or inflection point <m>x=c</m>,
            determine the value of <m>y=f(c)</m>.

    <title>Full Curve Sketching Examples</title>
    <example xml:id="ex_curvesketch1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Below, we give a full curve sketch of <m>f(x) = \dfrac{\ln x}{x}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Domain:</em> We must have <m>x\neq 0</m> from the denominator and <m>x>0</m> from the logarithm,
          hence the domain is <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><m>\mathbf{y}</m>-Intercept:</em>
          Since <m>x=0</m> is not in the domain of <m>f</m>,
          there is no <m>y</m>-intercept.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><m>\mathbf{x}</m>-Intercepts:</em>
          <m>f(x) = 0</m> where <m>\ln x=0</m>, so where <m>x=e^0=1</m>.
          Thus there is an <m>x</m>-intercept at the point <m>(1,0)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><m>\mathbf{f}</m> Positive and Negative:</em>
          We test whether <m>f</m> is positive or negative on each interval of its domain between roots:
        </p>
        <tabular>
          <row bottom="minor">
            <cell></cell>
            <cell></cell>
            <cell></cell>
          </row>
          <row>
            <cell>Interval</cell>
            <cell><m>(0,1)</m></cell>
            <cell><m>(1,\infty)</m></cell>
          </row>
          <row bottom="minor">
            <cell></cell>
            <cell></cell>
            <cell></cell>
          </row>
          <row>
            <cell><m>f</m> is</cell>
            <cell><m>-</m></cell>
            <cell><m>+</m></cell>
          </row>
          <row bottom="minor">
            <cell></cell>
            <cell></cell>
            <cell></cell>
          </row>
        </tabular>
        <p>
          Thus the graph of <m>f</m> is below the <m>x</m>-axis for
          <m>0\lt x\lt 1</m> and above the <m>x</m>-axis for <m>x>1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Even/odd Symmetry:</em>
          <m>f(x) = \dfrac{\ln x}{x}</m> is neither even nor odd.
          As we observed,
          <m>f(x)</m> is defined for <m>x>0</m> and so we cannot even evaluate <m>f(-x)</m>,
          since <m>-x\lt 0</m> is not in the domain of the function.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Vertical Asymptotes:</em> <m>f</m> has a potential vertical asymptote at <m>x=0</m>.
          Since <m>f</m> is only defined for <m>x>0</m>,
          we take only the right limit at <m>0</m>:
          <me>
            \ds\lim_{x\to 0+}\dfrac{\ln x}{x} = \dfrac{-\infty}{0^+} = -\infty
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus there is a vertical asymptote to the right of <m>x=0</m> that goes to <m>-\infty</m>.
          Note that this matches the information from testing where <m>f</m> is positive and negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Horizontal Asymptotes:</em>
          Since <m>f</m> is defined only for <m>x>0</m>,
          we need only check the behavior of <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x\to\infty</m>.
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{\ln x}{x} \amp = \frac{\infty}{\infty}\amp \leftarrow \text{ indeterminate form }  \frac{\infty}{\infty}\\ \amp \stackrel[L'H]{}= \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{1/x}{1}\amp  \leftarrow \text{ apply L'H\^opital's rule } \\ \amp = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{x} = 0 \amp \leftarrow \text{ simplify and evaluate } \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>f</m> has a right horizontal asymptote to <m>y=0</m>.
          Since <m>f</m> is positive for <m>x>1</m>,
          we know the function must approach <m>y=0</m> from above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Critical Points:</em> We calculate <m>f'(x)</m> using the quotient rule,
          then simplify and determine where it is 0 and undefined.
          <me>
            f'(x) = \frac{x(1/x)-\ln x(1)}{x^2} = \frac{1-\ln x}{x^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>f'(x) = 0</m> when <m>1-\ln x=0</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}1-\ln x \amp =0\\ 1 \amp = \ln x\\ e \amp = x \end{aligned}
          </me>
          and <m>f'(x)</m> DNE when <m>x=0</m>,
          which is not in the domain and so is not a critical point.
          Thus the only critical point of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>x=e</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><m>\mathbf{f}</m> Increasing and Decreasing:</em>
          We test whether <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing on each interval of its domain between critical points by determining the sign of <m>f'(x)</m>:

        <p>
          <em>Local Extrema:</em> Since <m>f</m> changes from increasing to decreasing,
          there is a local maximum at the critical point <m>x=e</m>.
          The <m>y</m>-value is <m>y = f(e) = \dfrac{\ln e}{e} = \dfrac{1}{e}</m> so the local maximum is at the point <m>(e,\frac{1}{e})\approx (2.718, 0.368)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Concavity:</em> We calculate <m>f''(x)</m>,
          again using the quotient rule,
          then simplify and determine where it is 0 and undefined.
          <me>
            f''(x) = \frac{x^2(-1/x)-(1-\ln x)(2x)}{(x^2)^2} = \frac{-x-2x(1-\ln x)}{x^4} = \frac{x(-1-2+2\ln x)}{x^4}  = \frac{2\ln x-3}{x^3}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>f''(x) = 0</m> when <m>2\ln x-3=0</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}2\ln x-3 \amp = 0\\ 2\ln x \amp =3\\ \ln x \amp =\frac{3}{2}\\ x \amp = e^{3/2}\approx 4.481 \end{aligned}
          </me>
          and <m>f''(x)</m> DNE when <m>x=0</m>,
          which is not in the domain.
          Thus the only critical point of <m>f'(x)</m> is <m>x=e^{3/2}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We test whether <m>f</m> is concave up or concave down on each interval of its domain between critical points of <m>f'(x)</m> by determining the sign of <m>f''(x)</m>:

          <em>Inflection Points:</em> Since <m>f</m> changes concavity,

          The <m>y</m>-value is <m>f(e^{3/2}) = \dfrac{\ln(e^{3/2})}{e^{3/2}} = \dfrac{3/2}{e^{3/2}}\approx 0.335</m>,

          <em>Sketch:</em> Begin by plotting the root, local maximum,

          Then draw the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
          Lastly, draw curves connecting these features with the appropriate shape on each of the intervals:

          Thus the graph of <m>g</m> is below the <m>x</m>-axis for <m>x\lt 0</m> and above the <m>x</m>-axis for <m>x>0</m>.

          <em>Even/odd Symmetry:</em> <m>g(-x) = (-x)e^{-(-x)} = -xe^x</m>.
          This is equal to neither <m>g(x) = xe^{-x}</m> nor <m>-g(x) = -xe^{-x}</m>,
          and so <m>g(x)</m> is neither even nor odd.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Vertical Asymptotes:</em> Since <m>g(x)</m> is continuous on its domain,
          which is all real numbers,
          there cannot be any vertical asymptotes,
          a.k.a. infinite discontinuities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Horizontal Asymptotes:</em>
          We test the behavior of <m>g(x)</m> as
          <m>x\to\infty</m> and <m>x\to-\infty</m>.
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to\infty} xe^{-x} \amp = \infty\cdot 0 \amp  \leftarrow\text{ indeterminate limit } \\ \amp = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x}{e^x} = \frac{\infty}{\infty} \amp \leftarrow\text{ algebra; indeterminate limit } \\ \amp \stackrel[L'H]{}= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{e^x} \amp  \leftarrow\text{ L'H\^opital's Rule } \\ \amp = \frac{1}{\infty} = 0 \amp  \leftarrow\text{ evaluate } \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>g(x)</m> has a right horizontal asymptote at <m>y=0</m>.
          Since <m>g</m> is positive for <m>x>0</m>,
          we know the function must approach <m>y=0</m> from above.
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to-\infty} xe^{-x} = -\infty\cdot e^{-(-\infty)} = -\infty\cdot\infty = -\infty
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>g(x)</m> does not have a left horizontal asymptote.
          Instead, the function becomes infinitely large and negative as <m>x\to-\infty</m>.
          This fits with our sign analysis of <m>g</m>,
          since <m>g</m> is negative for <m>x\lt 0</m>.

          <em>Critical Points:</em> Taking the derivative via the product rule and then factoring:

            g'(x) = (1)e^{-x}+x(-e^{-x}) = e^{-x}(1-x)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence we see that <m>g'(x)=0</m> when either <m>e^{-x}=0</m> or <m>1-x=0</m>,
          and there are no <m>x</m>-values where <m>g'(x)</m> does not exist.
          <m>e^{-x}>0</m> for all <m>x</m> so that equation has no solutions.
          <m>1-x=0</m> when <m>x=1</m>,
          thus the only critical point of <m>g</m> is <m>x=1</m>.

          The <m>y</m>-value is <m>g(1) = (1)e^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{e}</m> so the local maximum is at the point <m>\left(1,\frac{1}{3}\right)\approx (1,0.368)</m>.

        <p>
          <em>Domain:</em> <m>h(x) = \dfrac{\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x}</m> is undefined when <m>x=0</m> and when <m>x^2-1\lt 0</m>.
          <m>x^2-1 = (x-1)(x+1) = 0</m> when <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=-1</m>,

          and that <m>x^2-1\lt 0</m> when <m>-1\lt x\lt 1</m>.
          Thus <m>h(x)</m> is undefined on <m>(-1,1)</m>,

          Note in particular that <m>h(-1) = 0</m> and <m>h(1) = 0</m> are defined,
          so there are no vertical asymptotes at the edges of the domain.

        <p>
          Notice that we are right back where we started.
          Despite making no errors, L'H&#xf4;pital's Rule will not solve this limit for us.
          Instead, we need the algebraic methods from Chapter 2:
          divide both the numerator and denominator by <m>x</m>,
          the highest power of <m>x</m> that appears in the denominator.
          To simplify in the numerator,
          we multiply by <m>\frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{x^2}}</m> so that we can combine the square roots:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{1/x^2}}{1/x} \amp =\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{(x^2-1)(\frac{1}{x^2})}}{1}\\ \amp = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{x^2}}}{1}\\ \amp = \frac{\sqrt{1-0}}{1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>h</m> has a right horizontal asymptote at <m>y=1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, L'H&#xf4;pital's Rule will not work with the limit as <m>x\to-\infty</m>.
          We follow the same algebraic step of dividing through by <m>x</m>.
          However, now since <m>x\lt 0</m> as <m>x\to-\infty</m>,
          it is no longer true that <m>\sqrt{x^2} =x</m>.
          Instead, <m>\sqrt{x^2} = -x</m>,
          and so we multiply the numerator by <m>\frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{-\sqrt{x^2}} = -\sqrt{\frac{1}{x^2}}</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x}\cdot\frac{-\sqrt{1/x^2}}{1/x} \amp = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{-\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{x^2}}}{1}\\ \amp = \frac{-\sqrt{1-0}}{1} = \frac{-1}{1} = -1 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>h</m> has a left horizontal asymptote at <m>y=-1</m>.
          We could have avoided this additional computation
          (and the potential algebra error)
          by using our observation that <m>h(x)</m> is odd,
          so that if <m>\lim_{x\to\infty}h(x) = 1</m>,
          then <m>\lim_{x\to-\infty}h(x) = -1</m>.
          Note that this also fits with our sign analysis of <m>h</m>,
          since <m>h</m> is negative for <m>x\lt -1</m>.

          <em>Critical Points:</em> Taking the derivative via the quotient and chain rules and then simplifying:

            \begin{aligned}h'(x) \amp = \frac{x\cdot\frac{1}{2}(x^2-1)^{-1/2}(2x)-\sqrt{x^2-1}(1)}{x^2}\\ \amp = \frac{(x^2-1)^{-1/2}(x^2-(x^2-1))}{x^2}\\ \amp = \frac{1}{x^2\sqrt{x^2-1}} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see that <m>h'</m> is still undefined when
          <m>x^2-1\lt 0</m>, so on <m>(-1,1)</m>,
          but additionally, it is undefined at <m>x=\pm 1</m>.
          Thus <m>h</m> has two critical points at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m>.

          <em>Local Extrema:</em> Since <m>h</m> increases to the left of the critical point <m>x=-1</m> and is undefined to the right,
          <m>x=-1</m> is a local maximum.
          The <m>y</m>-value is <m>g(-1) = \frac{\sqrt{(-1)^2-1}}{-1} = \frac{0}{1} = 0</m>.
          Thus <m>(-1,0)</m> is a local maximum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, since <m>h</m> is undefined to the left of <m>x=1</m> and increases to the right,
          <m>x=1</m> is a local minimum.
          The <m>y</m>-value is <m>g(1) = \frac{\sqrt{1^2-1}}{1} = \frac{0}{1} = 0</m>.
          Thus <m>(1,0)</m> is a local minimum.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Concavity:</em> Calculating <m>h''(x)</m> is best done using the chain rule,
          first rewriting <m>h'(x) = (x^2\sqrt{x^2-1})^{-1}</m>,
          along with the product rule.
          Following this, we simplify as much as possible:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}h''(x) \amp = -(x^2\sqrt{x^2-1})^{-2}\cdot\left((2x)\sqrt{x^2-1}+x^2\cdot\frac{1}{2}(x^2-1)^{-1/2}(2x)\right)\\ \amp =\frac{-x(x^2-1)^{-1/2}(2(x^2-1)+x^2)}{x^4(x^2-1)}\\ \amp =\frac{-(2x^2-2+x^2)}{x^3(x^2-1)^{1+1/2}}\\ \amp =\frac{2-3x^2}{x^3(x^2-1)^{3/2}} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see again that <m>h''(x)</m> is undefined for <m>-1\leq x\leq1</m>.
          Additionally, <m>h''(x) = 0</m> when <m>2-3x^2 = 0</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}2-3x^2 \amp = 0\\ 2 \amp = 3x^2\\ \frac{2}{3} \amp = x^2\\ \pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \amp = x \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          However, <m>\pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\approx \pm 0.816</m> are not in the domain of <m>h</m>,

          <em>Local Extrema:</em> Since <m>k</m> is undefined to the left of <m>x=-1</m> and decreases to the right,
          <m>x=-1</m> must be a local maximum.
          Since <m>k</m> changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>x=0</m>,
          there is a local minimum at <m>x=0</m>.
          Lastly, since <m>k</m> is increasing to the left of <m>x=1</m> and undefined to the right,
          <m>x=1</m> must be a local maximum.
          Thus there are local maxima at the points
          <m>\left(-1,\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> and <m>\left(1,\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m>,
          and a local minimum at the point <m>(0,0)</m>.

          <em>Concavity:</em> Calculating <m>k''(x)</m> using the quotient and chain rules,

          <me>
            \begin{aligned}k''(x) \amp = \frac{\sqrt{1-x^4}(2)-(2x)\cdot\frac{1}{2}(1-x^4)^{-1/2}(-4x^3)}{(\sqrt{1-x^4})^2}\\ \amp =\frac{(1-x^4)^{-1/2}(2(1-x^4)+4x^4)}{1-x^4}\\ \amp =\frac{2-2x^4+4x^4}{(1-x^4)^{1+1/2}}\\ \amp = \frac{2+2x^4}{(1-x^4)^{3/2}} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see that <m>k''(x)</m> is undefined for <m>x=\pm 1</m> where <m>x^4=1</m>.
          Additionally, <m>k''(x) = 0</m>,
          when <m>2+2x^4 = 2(1+x^4) = 0</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}2(1+x^4) \amp =0\\ 1+x^4 \amp =0\\ x^4 \amp = -1 \end{aligned}
          </me>
          which has no solutions since <m>x^4\geq 0</m> for all <m>x</m>.
          Since <m>x\pm 1</m> are not in the domain of <m>k'</m>,
          there are no critical points of <m>k'</m>.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> We can determine a fairly accurate graph of functions by hand using limits and calculus,
      and only using a calculator occasionally to approximate values via decimals.
      This analysis can be even more precise than what we see by graphing the function with a computer as some features can be hard to see on a screen unless we know to look for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      Knowing precise definitions and the methods learned throughout the course are crucial for completing a full curve sketch.
      This section is a way for you to test your cumulative knowledge and pinpoint what ideas you need to review prior to the final exam.
