    <title>Definitions of Power Functions</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <em>power function</em> is a function that can be written in the form
          <me>
            f(x) = Ax^k
          </me>
          for some nonzero real number <m>A</m> and some rational number <m>k</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For example, <m>f(x)=8x^3</m>,
      <m>g(x) = 8x^{17/5}</m>, and
      <m>h(x) = 1</m> are all power functions.
      Note that <m>h(x)</m> can be rewritten in the form
      <me>
        h(x) = 1\cdot x^0
      </me>,
      which is why it is a power function
      (with <m>A=1</m> and <m>k=0</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this definition, the constant <m>k</m> is called the
      <em>power</em> or <em>exponent</em>,
      and the constant <m>A</m> is called the <em>coefficient</em>.
      Note that the exponent <m>k</m> must be a
      <em>rational number</em>.
      A rational number is a real number that can be written as a quotient of the form
      <m>\frac{p}{q}</m> for some integers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> with <m>q\neq 0</m>.
      The variable must be in the base;
      this means that, for example,
      <m>f(x) = x^{\pi}</m> and <m>f(x) = 10^x</m> are not considered power functions.
    </p>

      <title>Identifying power functions</title>

          Recall that power functions can be written in the form <m>f(x) = Ax^k</m>.
          <m>A</m> can be any nonzero real number,
          while <m>k</m> must be a rational number,
          meaning a fraction or finite/repeating decimal.

                As a decimal, <m>\sqrt{2}</m> never repeats or ends,
                and we cannot write <m>\sqrt{2}</m> as a fraction.

                Remember that <m>A</m> is allowed to be any real number,
                not just integers or rational numbers.

                <m>3(5^x)</m> is not a power function because the variable <m>x</m> is in the exponent,
                instead of the base.
                This is an example of a <em>transcendental</em> function,

    <p>
      Notice that we say a function <m>f</m> is a power function if it <em>can</em>
      be written in the form <m>f(x) = Ax^k</m> for some constants <m>A</m> and <m>k</m>;
      it may not start out written that way.
      Sometimes it can take a great deal of algebra to determine whether or not a function is a power function "in disguise."

          </me>
          a power function?

        <p>
          We can expand, factor,

          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{(2x)^3+8x^{17/5}}{x^{2/5}+1} = \frac{8x^3+8x^{17/5}}{x^{2/5}+1} = \frac{8x^3(1+x^{17/5-3})}{x^{2/5}+1} = \frac{8x^3(1+x^{2/5})}{x^{2/5}+1} = 8x^3

          </me>
          in the form <m>Ax^k</m> to see that it is a power function.

    <title>Integer Power Functions</title>
    <p>
      <em>Four Shapes of Integer Power Functions:</em>
      The simplest power functions are those whose exponents are integers.
      It turns out that we can classify power functions with integer exponents into four types,
      depending on whether <m>k</m> is even or odd,
      and also positive or negative.
      The next theorem illustrates these types for <m>f(x) = Ax^k</m> when <m>A=1</m>.
      The graphs for <m>A\lt 0</m> are reflected over the <m>x</m>-axis.

          domain, range,

      Recalling Definition <xref ref="def_polynomialfunction" autoname="yes"/> from the previous section,
      polynomial functions are sums of power functions with positive integer exponents <m>k>0</m>,

      <em>The Size of <m>k</m> Affects the Steepness:</em>
      While the sign and parity
      (whether it's even or odd)
      of the integer power <m>k</m> together determine the general shape of a power function <m>f(x) = x^k</m>,
      the <em>size</em> of <m>k</m> determines the steepness of the curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage303a-1" autoname="yes"/> below,
      <m>f(x) = x^2, f(x) = x^4</m>,
      and <m>f(x) = x^6</m> all have the same basic "U" shape,
      but the red graph of <m>f(x) = x^4</m> is steeper on the ends and flatter in the middle than the blue graph of <m>f(x) = x^2</m>,
      and the green graph of <m>f(x) = x^6</m> is steeper and flatter still.
      In each of the following figures,
      the largest value of <m>|k|</m> has the steepest and flattest curve.

    <title>Power Functions with Rational Powers</title>
    <p>
      Things get a little more complicated when we consider graphs of power functions
      <m>f(x) = x^k</m> where <m>k</m> is a reduced rational number <m>\frac{p}{q}</m>,
      meaning that <m>k</m> is a fraction that cannot be simplified.
      For example, when <m>q</m> is even,
      <m>x^{p/q}=(\sqrt[q]{x})^p</m> will be undefined for negative values of <m>x</m>,
      since we cannot take an even root of a negative number.
      A concrete example of this is when <m>q=1</m> and <m>p=2</m>, so that
      <me>
        x^{p/q} = x^{1/2} = \sqrt{x}
      </me>,
      and we know that the domain of <m>\sqrt{x}</m> is <m>x\geq 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For positive rational powers
      <m>\frac{p}{q}</m> there are six possible types of graphs that a power function <m>x^{p/q}</m> can have:

      <title>Power Functions with Positive Rational Powers</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\frac{p}{q}</m> is a positive reduced rational number,
          then the graph of <m>f(x) = x^{p/q} = (\sqrt[q]{x})^p</m> has the following shape,
          domain, range,
          and roots,
          depending on the parity of <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> and whether

          Note that since <m>\frac{p}{q}</m> is assumed to be reduced,
          we cannot have both <m>p</m> even and <m>q</m> even.
          Thus in the cases when <m>q</m> is even,
          we must have that <m>p</m> is odd.

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the graphs in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage304a-1" autoname="yes"/> could be the graphs of <m>y=x^{2/3}, y = x^{1/3}</m>,
          and <m>y=x^{1/2}</m>, from left to right,
          since <m>2/3, 1/3</m>, and <m>1/2</m> are all between 0 and 1.
          Additionally,
          <m>y=x^{2/3}</m> has <m>p=2</m> even and <m>q=3</m> odd.
          <m>y = x^{1/3}</m> has <m>p=1</m> odd and <m>q=3</m> odd.

          <m>y=x^{4/3}</m> has <m>p=4</m> even and <m>q=3</m> odd.
          <m>y=x^{5/3}</m> has <m>p=5</m> odd and <m>q=3</m> odd.
          <m>y=x^{3/2}</m> has <m>p=3</m> odd and <m>q=2</m> even.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      \fbox{The point is <em>not</em>
      to memorize these graphs,
      but rather to think about what kind of shape they
      <em>should</em> have based on the power!
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when <m>p</m> is even and <m>q</m> is odd,
      the graph must be above the <m>x</m>-axis because for <m>x^{p/q} = (\sqrt[q]{x})^p</m>,
      after taking the <m>q</m>th root,
      we are raising to an even power of <m>p</m>,
      which will make the function greater than or equal to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, when <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are both odd,
      <m>x^{p/q} = (\sqrt[q]{x})^p</m> will be negative when <m>x</m> is negative,
      and positive when <m>x</m> is positive,
      since raising to an odd power <m>p</m> will preserve whether the expression is positive or negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cases where the denominator of the power <m>q</m> is even,
      <m>x^{p/q} = (\sqrt[q]{x})^p</m> requires us to take the <m>q^{th}</m> root first.
      Always remember that we cannot take even roots of negative numbers,
      hence the domain is restricted to <m>x\geq 0</m>. }}
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, we have examined power functions
      <m>f(x) = x^{p/q}</m> where <m>\frac{p}{q}</m> is positive.
      What happens when the power is negative?
      By properties of exponents, we have
      <me>
        f(x) = x^{-p/q} = \frac{1}{x^{p/q}}
      </me>
      and thus the function <m>f(x) = x^{-p/q}</m> is the reciprocal of the function <m>g(x) = x^{p/q}</m>.
      This means that the height of <m>f(x)</m> at any point <m>x</m> is simply the reciprocal of the height of <m>g(x)</m> at that point <m>x</m>.
      For example,
      whenever <m>g(x)</m> is equal to 1, <m>f(x)</m> will also equal <m>\frac{1}{1} = 1</m>.
      Whenever <m>g(x)</m> is large,
      <m>f(x)</m> will be small;
      and whenever <m>g(x)</m> is small,
      <m>f(x)</m> will be large.
      Finally, if <m>g(x)</m> is zero,
      then <m>f(x)</m> will have a vertical asymptote,
      and vice versa, as illustrated in the following three figures.

              <p>
                If we rewrite the power function as a fraction with positive powers,
                the calculation of the domain is more clear:
                <me>
                  f(x) = 3x^{-2} = \frac{3}{x^2}

                so its domain is <m>(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)</m>.
                Note that the power of <m>-2</m> is not being applied to the coefficient <m>3</m>,
                only to the <m>x</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Again, it's helpful to rewrite the function so that we can see roots and powers clearly.
                <me>
                  g(x) = 2x^{3/4} = 2(\sqrt[4]{x})^3
                </me>
                The function is defined everywhere except <m>x\lt 0</m>,
                because of the even root, so its domain is <m>[0,\infty)</m>.
                Again, note that the coefficient 2 is not affected by the exponent.

            <li>
              <p>
                Start by rewriting again.
                This time we must first rewrite as a fraction with positive exponents and then using integer roots and powers.

                  h(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^{-4/5} =\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{x^{4/5}} =  \frac{1}{2(\sqrt[5]{x})^4}

          The <em>distance</em> between two real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is <m>\text{ dist } (a,b) = \sqrt{(b-a)^2}</m>.

        <p>
          For example, we know that the distance between 5 and 3 is 2.
          Using the above formula:
          <me>
            \text{ dist } (3,5) = \sqrt{(5-3)^2} = \sqrt{(2)^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that it doesn't matter whether we compute
          <m>\text{ dist } (3,5)</m> or <m>\text{ dist } (5,3)</m>:
          <me>
            \text{ dist } (5,3) = \sqrt{(3-5)^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2
          </me>
          since once we square <m>5-3 = 2</m> or <m>3-5 = -2</m>,
          they are both equal to positive 4.

      The above formula is a one-dimensional version of the more familiar formula for the distance between two points in the Cartesian plane:<fn>
      The Cartesian plane was named after the philosopher-mathematician Ren&#xe9; Descartes,
      who is credited as the father of analytic geometry and whose work formed the basis for the development of calculus.

      <title>Distance Between Two Points in the Plane</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <em>distance</em> between two points <m>P=(x_1,y_1)</m> and
          <m>Q=(x_2,y_2)</m> in the plane is given by the
          <em>distance formula</em>:
          <me>
            \text{ dist } (P,Q) = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 +(y_2-y_1)^2}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Here is a basic example of how to use this formula:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Plot the points <m>P=(-1,3)</m> and <m>Q=(4,-2)</m> on a set of axes,
          and sketch the line segment connecting these two points.
          Use the distance formula to find the length of this line segment.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The points <m>P=(-1,3)</m> and
          <m>Q=(4,-2)</m> and the line segment between them are shown in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage10" autoname="yes"/>:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_TaalmanPage10">
          <caption>The points <m>P=(-1,3)</m> and <m>Q=(4,-2)</m> and the line segment between them.</caption>
          <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage10.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The distance between <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> is
          <me>
            \text{ dist } (P,Q) = \sqrt{(-4-(-1))^2+(-2-3)^2} = \sqrt{5^2+(-5)^2} = \sqrt{50}\approx 7.071\text{ units }
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Here is an example of how this formula might be used in a real-world problem:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose a straight road runs past a monument.
          If we create a set of axes that puts the monument at the origin (the point <m>(0,0)</m>),
          the road is described by the function <m>f(x) = 2-x</m>,
          where <m>x</m> is measured in hundreds of feet.
          Find a function <m>d(x)</m> that gives the <em>distance</em>
          from a point <m>(x,f(x))</m> on the road to the monument.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          If we call the monument <m>P=(x_1,y_1)</m>,
          we have <m>x_1=0</m> and <m>y_1=0</m>.
          If we call a point on the road <m>Q=(x_2,y_2)</m>,
          then we have <m>x_2=x</m> and <m>y_2=f(x)</m>,
          since any point on the road has coordinates <m>(x,f(x))</m>.
          Since <m>f(x) = 2-x</m>, we have that <m>y_2 = f(x) = 2-x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The distance <m>d(x)</m> is then
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}d(x) = \text{ dist } (P,Q) \amp  = \sqrt{(x-0)^2+(2-x-0)^2} \\ \amp = \sqrt{x^2+(4-4x+x^2)} \\ \amp = \sqrt{2x^2-4x+4} \text{ hundred feet } . \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let's take a moment to think about the function we created in the previous example and the properties it should have based on the context from which it was developed.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's consider the domain of the function <m>d(x) = \sqrt{2x^2-4x+4}</m>,
          the distance
          (in hundreds of feet)
          between the monument and a point on the road with location <m>(x,f(x))</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intuitively,
          if we consider the problem of finding the distance between a road and a monument,
          we should be able to find a distance for any point on the road.
          So in our model <m>d(x)</m>, the domain should be all real numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Algebraically, note that since there is a square root involved,
          we need the quantity within the square root to be non-negative.
          The quantity in the square root is <m>2x^2-4x+4</m>.
          This is a quadratic expression with discriminant <m>b^2-4ac = (-4)^2-4(2)(4) = 16-32=-16</m>,
          and so the expression is never zero.
          Plugging in, for example <m>x=0</m>,
          we see that <m>2x^2-4x+4 = 2(0)^2-4(0)+4=4</m>,
          and so the quadratic expression is always positive.
          In other words,
          the quadratic has no zeros and there is a point above the <m>x</m>-axis,
          so we know it is always above the <m>x</m>-axis.
          In other-other words,
          the expression <m>2x^2-4x+4</m> is always positive!
          So the quantity under the square root is never negative,
          meaning that the function is defined for all <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are relieved that our algebra and our intuition match.
          It bodes well that we did not make a mistake in developing our model.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could also ask whether <m>d(x) = \sqrt{2x^2-4x+4}</m> has any zeros and whether it is increasing and/or decreasing.
          This would correspond to whether the road passes through the monument
          (it doesn't)
          and whether we get closer or farther away from the monument as we travel along the road
          (intuitively,
          we should first get closer and then as we pass the monument,
          we get farther).
          A graph of <m>d(x)</m> confirms both of these facts:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <caption>The graph of <m>d(x) = \sqrt{2x^2-4x+4}</m> is never zero and first decreases, then increases.</caption>
          <image width="56%" source="MonumentDistanceGraph.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Here is another thing we can see from the graph:
          the closest point on the road to the monument is at the location with <m>x=1</m>.
          We will learn to determine all of these properties algebraically using calculus later in the course.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Another application of calculating the distance between points is the method of Least Squares Regression,
      which finds the line of best fit given a collection of data points:
    </p>
    <url href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-regression.html">https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-regression.html</url>.
    <p>
      This method works by making the square of the errors between the points and the line as small as possible.
      These "errors" are precisely distances between points and the line that is being found.
      Least Squares Regression is a common method used for Statistical analysis in many different fields,
      from finance and economics to politics and sociology.

    <title>A Summary of Algebraic Functions</title>
    <p>
      A function is <em>algebraic</em>
      if it can be expressed in terms of constants and a variable <m>x</m> by using only arithmetic operations <m>(+, -, \times</m>,
      and <m>\div)</m> and rational constant powers of the variables.
      For example
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{3x^2-5}{1-x}  \text{ and }  g(x) = (\sqrt{x}+\sqrt[3]{x})^{7/2}
      </me>
      are algebraic functions,
      but <m>h(x) = 2^x</m> and <m>k(x)=\sin x</m> are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four basic types of algebraic functions,
      which we have already investigated:
      linear functions, polynomial functions,
      rational functions, and power functions.
      More complicated algebraic functions can be constructed by using sums (<m>+</m>),
      differences (<m>-</m>), products (<times/>),
      and quotients (<m>\div</m>) of these four basic types.
      <xref ref="tab_liboffunctions" autoname="yes"/> gives a general form and examples for each type:

      Functions that are not algebraic are called

      exponential, logarithmic,
      trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions.

                Furthermore, since we can write <m>-2x+1 = \frac{-2x+1}{1}</m>,
                <m>k(x)</m> is a rational function as well,
                with <m>p(x) = -2x+1</m> and <m>q(x) = 1</m>.
                Therefore <m>k(x)</m> is an algebraic function that is linear,
                polynomial,
                and rational.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms and formulas were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    power function, power, exponent, coefficient, rational number; distance between two real numbers, distance between two points in the plane; algebraic and transcendental functions
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Just like linear and quadratic functions,
      power functions have predictable shapes.
      There are too many of them to memorize,
      but we can remember some of them based on the size and parity of the exponent,
      the domain,
      and whether the function is always positive or not.
      Power functions are used to find the distance between points.
      We have now learned about all of the different types of algebraic functions and will learn about transcendental functions later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      The coefficient <m>A</m> of a power function
      <m>f(x) = Ax^k</m> affects the shape of the graph by vertical stretching or compression,
      and reflects it over the <m>x</m>-axis if <m>A\lt 0</m>.
      An expression under an even root must be non-negative in order for the root to be defined.
