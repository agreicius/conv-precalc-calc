    <title>Definition of Piecewise-Defined Functions</title>
    <p>
      So far, you have learned about the different types of algebraic functions.
      In this section we discuss functions that are NOT algebraic functions.
      Instead, they are pieced together by parts of algebraic functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>piecewise-defined function</em>
      is a function that is defined in multiple pieces,
      with different formulas on different parts of its domain.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be the function defined piecewise by
          <me>
            f(x) = \begin{cases}x^2,\amp  \text{ if }  x\leq -1\\ 2x, \amp \text{ if } x>-1 \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that if we want to plug in an <m>x</m>-value that is <m>-1</m> or less,
          we use the formula <m>x^2</m> in the first row.
          If we want to plug in an <m>x</m>-value that is greater than <m>-1</m>,
          we use the formula <m>2x</m>.
          So the domain for the function is still <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>,
          but we use <m>x^2</m> on <m>(-\infty,-1]</m> and use <m>2x</m> on <m>(-1,\infty)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we want to find the value <m>f(-5)</m>,
          we observe that <m>x=-5\leq -1</m>,
          and so we use the formula <m>x^2</m> for this value of <m>x</m>:
          <me>
            f(-5) = (-5)^2 = 25
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we want to find the value <m>f(3)</m>,
          we observe that <m>x=3>-1</m>,
          and so we use the formula <m>2x</m> for this value of <m>x</m>:
          <me>
            f(3) = 2(3) = 6
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we want to find the value <m>f(-1)</m>,
          we observe that <m>x=-1\leq -1</m>,
          because of the equal sign,
          and so we once again use the formula <m>x^2</m> for this value of <m>x</m>:
          <me>
            f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To graph <m>f</m>,
          we begin by graphing the functions <m>y=x^2</m> and <m>y=2x</m> that are used in the definition of <m>f</m>,
          as shown in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage46b" autoname="yes"/>:

          \caption{The graphs of <m>y=x^2</m> and <m>y=2x</m>.}
        </figure>
        <p>
          To graph <m>f</m>, we use the graph of <m>y=x^2</m> on the interval
          <m>(-\infty,-1]</m> and use <m>y=2x</m> on <m>(-1,\infty)</m>.
          Whether these intervals are open or closed is important.
          To find <m>f(-1)</m> we used the
          <em>first</em> equation <m>y=x^2</m>:
          <m>f(-1)=(-1)^2 = 1</m>.
          Note that when we sketch the graph of <m>f</m> below,
          we use open and closed dots to represent the function values corresponding to the ends of open and closed intervals in the domain,
          respectively.

    <title>An Application of Piecewise-defined Functions</title>
    <p>
      Piecewise-defined functions are useful for many real-word problems where the relationship between the quantities involved are different on different time-frames.
      For example, a person's salary changes when they get a raise,
      which changes the amount that they earn each year.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_incomefunction">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that in your first job after graduating from college you make $36,000 a year before taxes.
          After four years you get a raise of $2,500.
          Two years after that you change jobs and go to work for a company that pays you $49,000 a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can construct a piecewise-defined function that describes your pretax income in the year that is <m>t</m> years after you graduate from college as follows.
          Note that this is just the function that describes your income rate per year at a time <m>t</m>
          (the units are dollars per year).
          <me>
            \text{ income } (t) = \begin{cases}36000,\amp  \text{ if } 0\leq t\lt 4\\ 38500,\amp  \text{ if } 4\leq t\lt 6\\ 49000,\amp  \text{ if } t\geq6 \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          What may be more interesting is to describe that amount that you will have <em>earned</em>
          <m>t</m> years after graduating from college.
          During the first four years, you make $36,000 per year,
          and so the amount that you earn after <m>t</m> years is <m>36000t</m>.
          After four years,
          you have already earned $<m>36,000\cdot 4 = 144,000</m>.
          Then for the next two years, you earn $38,500 per year,
          so your additional income for
          <m>4\leq t\lt 6</m> is given by <m>38500(t-4)</m>
          (because we have to measure in years
          <em>since</em> <m>t=4</m>).
          Thus overall for <m>4\leq t\lt 6</m>,
          you have earned <m>144000+38500(t-4)</m> by time <m>t</m>.
          Lastly, after 6 years you have earned $<m>36,000\cdot 4+38,500\cdot2 = 221,000</m>,
          and for each additional year you earn $49,000,
          so by time <m>t</m> you have earned <m>21000+4900(t-6)</m> when <m>t\geq 6</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Summarizing this, the function for total <em>earnings</em>
          at time <m>t</m> years since graduation is
          <me>
            \text{ earnings } (t) = \begin{cases}36000t,\amp  \text{ if } 0\leq t\lt 4\\ 144000+38500(t-4),\amp  \text{ if } 4\leq t\lt 6\\ 221000+49000(t-6),\amp  \text{ if } t\geq 6 \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you continue at that pay rate,
          how long will it have taken you to earn a million dollars?
          Well, we know we did not make that much by <m>t=6</m>,
          so we use the equation for <m>t\geq 6</m> and solve for <m>t</m>:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}221000+49000(t-6) \amp = 1000000\\ 49000(t-6) \amp = 779000\\ t-6 \amp = \frac{779000}{49000}\approx 15.8980\\ t \amp \approx 21.8980 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          So in your 22nd year after graduating you will have earned one million pretax dollars.
        </p>

          How much will you have earned five years after graduating,
          according to the model described in Example <xref ref="ex_incomefunction" autoname="yes"/>?
          What is your salary in that year?

    <title>Absolute Value and Distance</title>
    <p>
      The absolute value function measures the size of a quantity,
      disregarding whether it is positive or negative.
      For a number visualized on the real number line,
      this also describes the distance of that number from 0.
      Said in another way,
      the absolute value of a real number <m>a</m> is the magnitude, or size,
      of <m>a</m> and is denoted <m>|a|</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, <m>|3|=3</m> and <m>|-3|=3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The absolute value of <m>a</m> "makes the number <m>a</m> positive." More precisely,
      if <m>a</m> is positive or zero,
      then taking the absolute value should do nothing:
      in this case <m>|a|=a</m>.
      However, if <m>a</m> is negative,
      then taking the absolute value should change the sign:
      in this case <m>|a|=-a</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, <m>|-3|=-(-3) = 3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      To define the absolute value function rigorously,
      we must use a piecewise-defined function.
      As just discussed,
      for positive numbers and zero, we must apply one rule
      (do nothing),
      and for negative numbers, we must apply another rule
      (multiply by <m>-1</m>).
      Here is the formal definition,
      which says precisely that.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def_absval">
      <title>Absolute Value</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <em>absolute value</em> of a real number <m>x</m> is
          <me>
            |x| = \begin{cases}x, \amp  \text{ if } x\geq 0\\ -x, \amp \text{ if } x\lt 0. \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The quantity <m>-x</m> is not necessarily negative;
        it depends on whether the number <m>x</m> is positive or negative.
        For example,
        if <m>x=-3</m>, then <m>-x = -(-3)=3</m> is positive.
        In <xref ref="def_absval">Definition</xref>,
        <m>|x|=-x</m> only if <m>x</m> is negative,
        in which case <m>-x</m> is a <em>positive number</em>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Absolute values distribute over products and quotients;
      for example,
      the absolute value of a product is simply the product of the absolute values.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Absolute Values Distribute over Products and Quotients</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given any real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
          <m>|ab| = |a||b|</m> and <m>\left|\dfrac{a}{b}\right| = \dfrac{|a|}{|b|}</m>.

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          <m>|(-2)(3)| = |-6| = 6</m> is equal to <m>|-2||3| = (2)(3) = 6</m>.

      <title>Non-Example</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Note that absolute values do <em>not</em>
          distribute over sums and differences.
          For example,
          <m>|-2+3| = |1| = 1</m> is not equal to <m>|-2|+|3| = 2+3 = 5</m>.

    <p>
      The absolute value <m>|a|</m> of any real number <m>a</m> is the distance between <m>a</m> and 0 on the real number line.
      Geometrically,
      the distance between any two real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is the length of the line segment from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> on the number line.
      Algebraically, this distance is given by <m>|b-a|</m>,
      regardless of the signs of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.

          the diagram that follows shows that the distance between <m>a=2</m> and <m>b=-1</m> is 3 units.

    <p>
      When <m>x</m> is positive,
      the square root of <m>x^2</m> returns us to the original <m>x</m>-value.
      When <m>x</m> is negative,
      <m>x^2</m> is positive and the square root denotes only the
      <em>positive</em> square root,
      so the square root of <m>x^2</m> will give us
      <m>|x| = -(x)</m>. (Remember, if <m>x</m> is negative,
      <m>-x</m> is positive!) So this different definition is exactly the same as <xref ref="def_absval" autoname="yes"/>, just stated in a different way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea can help us in solving the following types of common equations:
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the solution of <m>x^2=25</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          If we take the square root of both sides, we have
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}x^2 \amp = 25\\ \sqrt{x^2} \amp =\sqrt{25}\\ |x| \amp = 5\\ x \amp =\pm 5 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <m>\pm</m> comes from the following logic:
          if the magnitude of <m>x</m> is 5, <m>x</m> is 5 units away from 0 on the number line to either the right or the left.
          So <m>x</m> could be either positive or negative 5 units from 0, meaning that <m>x=5, -5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternately, we could solve via factoring.
          Approached in this way, we have
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}x^2 \amp = 25\\ x^2-25 \amp = 0\\ (x-5)(x+5) \amp =0\\ x-5 = 0 \amp  \text{ or }  \amp  x+5 = 0\\ x \amp = 5, -5 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus using either method,
          we can see that both <m>x=-5</m> and <m>x=5</m> are solutions to the equation <m>x^2=25</m>.
          Verify this by plugging in both numbers!
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Important!</em> It is very common for students to forget to include the <m>\pm</m> when taking the square root of a square.
          The main lesson to be learned from this example is that equations <m>x^2 = r^2</m> have <em>two</em>
          solutions: <m>x=\pm r</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let's reconcile the two definitions for the distance between real numbers.
      Definition <xref ref="def_distwithsquareroot" autoname="yes"/> tell us that
      <me>
        \text{ dist } (a,b) = \sqrt{(b-a)^2}
      </me>
      while Definition <xref ref="def_distwithabsvals" autoname="yes"/> combined with Definition <xref ref="def_altdefabsval" autoname="yes"/> tells us that
      <me>
        \text{ dist } (a,b) = |b-a| = \sqrt{(b-a)^2}
      </me>.
      Hooray!
      The two definitions agree.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Which definition of distance do you prefer?
          <m>\text{ dist } (a,b) = \sqrt{(b-a)^2}</m> or <m>\text{ dist } (a,b) = |b-a|</m>?
          Why?
          <em>You can use either one.
          As we showed, they agree with each other.</em>

      Of course, in general we might wish to take the absolute value of a more complicated expression.
      In the more general case, we do exactly the same thing:
      the absolute value will leave positive quantities untouched,
      but flip the sign of negative quantities.

      <title>The Absolute Value of a Function</title>

          The <em>absolute value of a function</em> <m>g(x)</m> is

            |g(x)| = \begin{cases}g(x), \amp \text{ for all } x\text{ with } g(x)\geq 0\\ -g(x),\amp \text{ for all } x\text{ with } g(x)\lt  0 \end{cases}

      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, consider the function
          <m>g(x) = 2x-1</m> and its absolute value <m>f(x) = |g(x)| = |2x-1|</m>.
          When <m>2x-1</m> is positive or zero
          (meaning when <m>x\geq 1/2</m>),
          the absolute value remains <m>2x-1</m>.
          But when <m>2x-1</m> is negative
          (meaning when <m>x\lt 1/2</m>)
          the absolute value of <m>g</m> is <m>-(2x-1)</m>.
          The graph of <m>y=|2x-1|</m> is a combination of the graphs of <m>y=2x-1</m> and <m>y=-(2x-1)</m>,

    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="ex_TaalmanSec0_5Ex4">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>f(x) = |x^2-1|</m>, calculate <m>f(-2), f(0)</m>,
          and <m>f(1)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's write <m>f(x) = |x^2-1|</m> from <xref ref="ex_TaalmanSec0_5Ex4">Exercise</xref>
          as a piecewise-defined function and then graph it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <m>x^2-1</m> is positive or zero,
          its absolute value will remain <m>x^2-1</m>.
          When <m>x^2-1</m> is negative,
          its absolute value will be <m>-(x^2-1)</m>.
          Therefore we have
          <me>
            f(x) = |x^2-1| = \begin{cases}x^2-1, \amp  \text{ for all } x\text{ with } x^2-1\geq 0\\ -(x^2-1), \amp  \text{ for all } x\text{ with } x^2-1\lt  0 \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this is one way to write <m>|x^2-1|</m> as a piecewise-defined function,
          it is difficult to work with.
          For example,
          to evaluate <m>f(-2)</m> we would need to know whether
          <m>x^2-1\geq 0</m> or <m>x^2-1\lt 0</m> when <m>x=-2</m>.
          To simplify this piecewise-defined function,
          we need to rewrite the conditions as intervals of <m>x</m>-values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the graph of <m>y=x^2-1</m>.
          We will use it to determine where
          <m>x^2-1\geq 0</m> and <m>x^2-1\lt 0</m>:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_xquaredminusonegraph">

          <image width="46%" source="xquaredminusonegraph.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          So we see that <m>x^2-1\geq 0</m> for <m>x\leq -1</m> and <m>x\geq 1</m>,
          and that <m>x^2-1\lt 0</m> for <m>-1\lt x\lt 1</m>.
          Rewriting the piecewise-defined function in terms of these intervals:
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we have
          <me>
            f(x) = |x^2-1| = \begin{cases}x^2-1, \amp  \text{ if }  x\leq -1\\ -(x^2-1), \amp   \text{ if }  -1\lt x\lt 1\\ x^2-1, \amp  \text{ if }  x\geq 1 \end{cases}

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    piecewise-defined function, absolute value, distance between real numbers (again)
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Piecewise-defined functions are not algebraic functions.
      They use different formulas on different intervals and their graphs are found by piecing together the graphs of the different formulas.
      Absolute value is an example of a piecewise-defined function and can be used to find distance.
      The graph of the absolute value of a function reflects the negative parts of the graph of the original function up over the horizontal axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      It would be great to have an algebraic way to determine when an expression is positive and negative,
      so we don't have to use a graph to find the absolute value of a function.
