    <title>Rules for Inequalities and Solving Linear Inequalities</title>
    <p>
      As we have seen over the last few sections,
      in order to determine when a function is positive and negative,
      find the domain of a function involving an even root,
      and rewrite an absolute value,
      we will need to be able to work with inequalities.
      We will need to solve inequalities in order to explore functions in general and answer many interesting questions,
      and so we summarize the relevant rules and develop the necessary techniques for solving inequalities.
      Let's begin by defining what we mean by an "inequality."
    </p>
    <p>
      An <em>inequality</em> consists of two mathematical expressions related by a greater-than <m>(>)</m>,
      less-than <m>(\lt )</m>,
      greater-than-or-equal-to <m>(\geq)</m>,
      or less-than-or-equal-to <m>(\leq)</m> sign.
      The <em>solution set</em> of an inequality is the set of all values that make the inequality true.
      Wheres the solution set of an equation often consists of a finite number of points,
      the solution set of an inequality is often an
      <em>interval</em> of real numbers.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the solution to <m>x-1=0</m> is the single number <m>x=1</m>.
          The solution to <m>x-1>0</m> is the <em>interval</em>
          of numbers <m>x>1</m>, or,
          written using interval notation, <m>(1,\infty)</m>.
          This means that if we take any number greater than one and subtract one,
          the result will be positive
          (meaning greater than 0).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The next theorem describes what happens to inequalities when they are inverted or multiplied by a nonzero constant.

    <theorem xml:id="thm_algrulesineq">
      <title>Algebraic Rules for Inequalities</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>a, b</m>, and <m>c</m> are nonzero real numbers.
          <ol marker="labelalphitemsep5pttopsep5pt">

                In other words,
                adding a number to both sides of an inequality does not reverse the inequality.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>

                In other words,
                multiplying both sides of an inequality by a positive number does not reverse the inequality.

                In other words,
                multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number
                <em>reverses the inequality</em>.

                If <m>0\lt a\lt b</m>, then <m>\frac{1}{a}>\frac{1}{b}</m>.
                In other words,
                taking reciprocals of two positive numbers reverses the inequality between the numbers.

    </theorem>
    <p>
      In particular,
      notice that part (c) implies that multiplying an inequality by a negative number "flips" the inequality;
      for example, if <m>a\lt b</m>, then <m>-a>-b</m>.
      Part (a) illustrates that we may add any number to,
      or subtract any number from,
      both sides of an inequality without changing the direction of the inequality.

      is written in terms of <em>strict inequalities</em> <m>></m> and <m>\lt</m>,
      but similar results apply for the inequalities <m>\geq</m> and <m>\leq</m>.

          nonzero number for <m>a, b</m>, and <m>c</m>.
          Note that for part (b),
          <m>c</m> must be positive and for part (c), <m>c</m> must be negative
          (so you will need to pick different values of <m>c</m> to illustrate those two parts).

    <p>
      We can use the rules in Theorem <xref ref="thm_algrulesineq" autoname="yes"/> to solve linear inequalities in <em>almost</em>
      the same way that we solve equalities.
      The only exception is multiplying
      (or dividing)
      by negative numbers, or taking reciprocals.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Solving a simple inequality</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the solution set of the inequality <m>3-2x>7</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, we can use part (a) of Theorem <xref ref="thm_algrulesineq" autoname="yes"/> to add <m>-3</m> to both sides,
          which is the same as subtracting <m>3</m> from both sides:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}3-2x \amp >7\\ (3-2x)-3 \amp >7-3\\ -2x\amp >4 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we can use part (c) of Theorem <xref ref="thm_algrulesineq" autoname="yes"/> to multiply both sides by <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m>,
          which is the same as dividing both sides by <m>-2</m>.
          Remember that this requires flipping the inequality!
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}-2x\amp >4\\ -\frac{1}{2}(-2x)\amp \lt -\frac{1}{2}(4) \\ x\amp \lt -2 \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the solution set of the original inequality is <m>(-\infty,-2)</m>.

      \fbox{ <em>Important Note!</em>
      Since multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number "flips" the inequality,
      you cannot multiply both sides of an inequality by a quantity whose sign you do not know.
      The following example illustrates a calculation where you must be especially careful about the algebraic steps you follow for precisely this reason. }
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we wish to solve <m>\frac{3}{x}>2</m>.
          You <em>cannot</em> multiply both sides of the inequality <m>\frac{3}{x}>2</m> by <m>x</m>,
          because <m>x</m> may be positive or negative.
          Therefore, you do not know whether or not multiplying both sides of an inequality by <m>x</m> will change the direction of the inequality.
          We will look at how to solve such an inequality later in this section.

    <title>Solving Inequalities That Involve Quadratics</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        If we want to know where a quadratic function
        <m>f(x) = ax^2+bx+c</m> is positive and negative,
        we need to be able to solve the inequalities
        <m>ax^2+bx+c>0</m> and <m>ax^2+bx+c\lt 0</m>.
        However, this comes with significantly more complication than solving a quadratic equality,
        which we see in the next example.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If we try to solve the inequality
            <m>x^2-x\lt 0</m> by adding <m>x</m> to both sides, we get
            <me>
              x^2\lt x
            </me>.
            We may be tempted to divide by <m>x</m> here, but remember,
            we do not know whether <m>x</m> is positive or negative,
            so we do not know whether to flip the inequality!
            We must use an alternate method for this problem,
            which is motivated by <xref ref="thm_signofproducts">Theorem</xref> below.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>
        Solving quadratic inequalities is best accomplished by factoring and using a key property of the real numbers:
        a product of two real numbers is positive if the numbers have the same sign and negative if the numbers have opposite signs.
        This property is stated carefully in the following theorem:
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm_signofproducts">
        <title>The Sign of a Product depends on the Signs of Its Factors</title>

                  (<m>A\lt 0</m> and <m>B\lt 0</m>).

      </theorem>
      <p>
        An easy <em>corollary</em>
        (meaning an immediate logical consequence that is interesting on its own)
        of this theorem is that <m>AB\geq 0</m> if and only if either <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same sign or one of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is zero.

        <xref ref="thm_signofproducts">Theorem</xref>
        reduces the problem of solving a factored inequality to the problem of solving a collection of related simpler inequalities.
      </p>
      <example xml:id="ex_quadsignanalysis">
        <statement>
          <p>
            For example, the expression in the inequality
            <m>x^2-x\lt 0</m> factors as <m>x(x-1)\lt 0</m>.
            The product of <m>x</m> and <m>x-1</m> is negative exactly when <m>x</m> and <m>x-1</m> have opposite signs.
            It's difficult to recognize exactly which values of <m>x</m> satisfies this condition,
            but it looks like it depends on whether <m>x</m> is below 0, between 0 and 1, or above 1. (Note that <m>x-1\lt 0</m> when <m>x\lt 1</m>,
            and <m>x-1>0</m> when <m>x>1</m>.) In other words,
            the zeros of <m>x^2-x</m> seem to break up the intervals where <m>x^2-x</m> could be positive or negative.

          <p>
            In <xref ref="tab_quadsignanalysis" autoname="yes"/>,
            we look at the sign of each factor of <m>x(x-1)</m> on the intervals between its zeros in order to determine the sign of the product.
            If we plug in a sample value of <m>x</m> on each of these intervals,
            it becomes easier to determine the signs:

            For example, on the interval <m>0\lt x\lt 1</m>,
            we can plug in a sample value of <m>x=0.5</m>.
            Then <m>x=0.5</m> is positive,
            <m>x-1 = 0.5-1 = -0.5</m> is negative,
            so the product <m>x(x-1) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25</m> is negative.
            From this we conclude that <m>x(x-1)</m> is negative on the entire interval <m>0\lt x\lt 1</m>.
            We will see in a later section <em>why</em>
            we can use a sample value on this interval to draw a conclusion about the sign on the entire interval.<fn>
            The theorem that tells us this is called the Intermediate Value Theorem.

            on a number line by making tick marks at each <m>x</m>-value that made the expression zero and writing <m>+</m>
            (for positive)
            or <m>-</m>
            (for negative)
            above each interval we tested,
            as shown in <xref ref="num_quadsignanalysis">Figure</xref>.
            Note that we include tick marks <em>only</em>
            at the potential sign-changing points.

            From our sign analysis,
            we see that <m>x(x-1)</m> is positive for <m>x\lt 0</m> and <m>x>1</m>,
            and negative for <m>0\lt x\lt 1</m>.
            We wished to find the solution to the inequality
            <me>
              x^2-x\lt 0\text{ meaning }  x(x-1)\lt 0
            </me>
            and so we see that the solution is values of <m>x</m> on the interval <m>0\lt x\lt 1</m>,
            which we write using interval notation as
            <me>
              x\in(0,1)

        In Example <xref ref="ex_quadsignanalysis" autoname="yes"/> above,
        we can see that the quadratic function
        <m>q(x) = x^2-x</m> { changes sign} at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=1</m>,
        where it is equal to zero.
        Visually, this is where the graph fully crosses the <m>x</m>-axis:

      </p>
      <p>
        As a rule, quadratic functions
        (and polynomials in general)
        are only able to change sign only where their graph crosses the <m>x</m>-axis:

        <title>When Can a Polynomial Change Sign?</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A polynomial can change sign only at values where it is equal to zero.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        This theorem is a special case of the Intermediate Value Theorem,
        which we will explore in Chapter 2.

      <p>
        <em>Important!</em> Just because a polynomial <em>can</em>
        change sign does not mean that it
        <em>does</em> change sign.
        The following example illustrates this fact.

            The quadratic function <m>q(x) = x^2+2x+1</m> factors as
            <m>(x+1)(x+1)</m> and so has a single zero at <m>x=-1</m> where it can change sign.
            We test points above and below <m>x=-1</m> to determine the sign of the expression by determining the sign of each factor:

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Application: Rewriting a Piecewise-Defined Function by Solving an Inequality</title>
      <p>
        In this subsection we see how to use inequalities to rewrite functions involving absolute values as piecewise-defined functions.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We wish to write <m>f(x) = |x^2-1|</m> from <xref ref="ex_TaalmanSec0_5Ex4">Exercise</xref>
            as a piecewise-defined function without needing to rely on a graph of <m>y=x^2-1</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When <m>x^2-1</m> is positive or zero,
            its absolute value will remain <m>x^2-1</m>.
            When <m>x^2-1</m> is negative,
            its absolute value will be <m>-(x^2-1)</m>.
            Therefore we have
            <me>
              f(x) = |x^2-1| = \begin{cases}x^2-1, \amp  \text{ for all } x\text{ with } x^2-1\geq 0\\ -(x^2-1), \amp  \text{ for all } x\text{ with } x^2-1\lt  0 \end{cases}
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus we need to determine where <m>y=x^2-1</m> is positive and negative.
            For this, we factor and complete a sign analysis:
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>x^2-1=(x+1)(x-1)=0</m> when <m>x=\pm1</m>,
            we test the sign of <m>x^2-1</m> for <m>x\lt -1, -1\lt x\lt 1</m>,
            and <m>x>1</m>:

    <title>Solving Inequalities That Involve Products and Quotients</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Recall <xref ref="thm_signofproducts">Theorem</xref>: The Sign of a Product <m>AB</m> Depends on the Signs of its Factors.
        This theorem also holds for quotients:
        <m>\frac{A}{B}</m> is greater than zero if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same sign and is less than zero if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have opposite signs.
        We can also generalize this theorem to products with more than two factors:
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm_gensignofproduct">
        <title>The Sign of a Product or Quotient Depends on the Number of Its Negative Factors</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A product or quotient of nonzero real numbers is positive if and only if it has an even number of negative factors and is negative if and only if it has an odd number of negative factors.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        For example,
        the product <m>(-2)(-1)(2)(-6)</m> is negative because it has an odd number of negative factors.
        In contrast,
        <m>\frac{(-3)(-2)(-8)}{(7)(-4)}</m> is positive because it has an even number of negative factors.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            As an illustration of the power of <xref ref="thm_gensignofproduct">Theorem</xref>,
            consider the problem of solving the inequality
            <me>
              (x^2+2)(x+1)(x-1)\lt 0
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applying <xref ref="thm_quotientchangesign">Theorem</xref>,
            the expression <m>(x^2+2)(x+1)(x-1)</m> is zero only when <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
            (Note that <m>x^2+2</m> is never zero; it is irreducible.)
            Therefore, these are the only two <m>x</m>-values at which the expression can change sign.
            That means that the expression has the same sign on the entire interval <m>(-\infty, -1)</m>,
            and the same sign on all of <m>(-1,1)</m>,
            and the same sign on all of <m>(1,\infty)</m>.
            Applying <xref ref="thm_gensignofproduct">Theorem</xref>,
            we can test the sign of each factor and multiply to find the sign of the entire product:

        There is also a version of <xref ref="thm_polynomialchangesign">Theorem</xref>

            The expression <m>\frac{1-2x}{x+1}</m> can change sign only when either the numerator or denominator is equal to zero,

            So we see that <m>h(x) = \frac{1-2x}{x+1}</m> is positive on
            <m>\left(-1,\frac{1}{2}\right)</m> and negative on <m>(-\infty,-1)\cup \left(\frac{1}{2},\infty\right)</m>.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <p>
        In the next example,
        we see how to solve an inequality where neither side is 0:
        we must rewrite the inequality so that one side <em>is</em>
        0 and then perform a sign analysis.
        This requires further simplifying the nonzero expression to be a quotient of fully factored expressions.
      </p>
      <example xml:id="ex_nonzeroineq">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Solve the inequality
            <me>
              \frac{3}{x+1}\geq 2
            </me>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Although it is tempting,
            recall that we can't multiply both sides of the inequality by <m>x+1</m> because <m>x+1</m> may be positive or may be negative
            (depending on the value of <m>x</m>).
            Instead, we will use some algebra to turn this inequality into one that involves a product or quotient of factors on one side and zero on the other:
            <me>
              \begin{aligned}\frac{3}{x+1} \amp \geq2 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ original inequality } \\ \frac{3}{x+1}-2 \amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ collect terms so 0 is on the right-hand side } \\ \frac{3}{x+1}-\frac{2(x+1)}{x+1}\amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ find common denominator } \\ \frac{3-2(x+1)}{x+1}\amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ combine fractions } \\ \frac{3-2x-2}{x+1}\amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ simplify numerator } \\ \frac{1-2x}{x+1}\amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ simplify numerator some more } \end{aligned}
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that none of the above steps has changed the values of <m>x</m> that can satisfy the inequalities.
            In other words, the inequality
            <m>\frac{3}{x+1} \geq2</m> has the same solution set as the inequality <m>\frac{1-2x}{x+1}\geq 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice that the latter inequality
            <m>\frac{1-2x}{x+1}\geq 0</m> is now a problem we have already solved!
            In Example <xref ref="ex_signofquotient" autoname="yes"/>,
            we found that the function
            <m>h(x) = \frac{1-2x}{x+1}</m> is positive for <m>x\in \left(-1,\frac{1}{2}\right)</m>.
            Additionally, the fraction
            <m>\frac{1-2x}{x+1}</m> is equal to zero when its numerator is zero,
            so for <m>x = \frac{1}{2}</m>.
            Thus
            <me>
              \frac{1-2x}{x+1}\geq 0 \text{ for }  x\in  \left(-1,\frac{1}{2}\right]
            </me>.
            Remembering that the two inequalities have the same solution sets,
            we realize that we have now solved the original problem,
            and conclude
            <me>
              \frac{3}{x+1}\geq 2\text{ for }  x\in  \left(-1,\frac{1}{2}\right]

      <title>Application: Finding the Domain of a Function with an Even Root</title>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find the domain of the algebraic function
            <me>
              f(x) = \sqrt{\frac{3}{x}-2}
            </me>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            To find the domain of <m>f</m>,
            we ask which values of <m>x</m> can be plugged into the equation that defines <m>f(x)</m> and produce a real number when the expression is simplified.
            In order for the value of <m>f</m> to be defined for a real number <m>x</m>,
            that value of <m>x</m> must make the expression underneath the square-root sign nonnegative
            (meaning <m>\frac{3}{x}-2\geq 0</m>)
            and the denominator appearing in <m>\frac{3}{x}</m> nonzero
            (meaning <m>x\neq 0</m>).
            Thus the domain of <m>f(x)</m> is the set of real numbers that satisfy:
            <me>
              \frac{3}{x}-2\geq 0\text{ and }  x\neq 0
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to tackle the inequality,
            we need to rewrite the left-hand side as a single fraction:
            <me>
              \begin{aligned}\frac{3}{x}-2 \amp \geq 0\amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ original inequality } \\ \frac{3}{x}-\frac{2x}{x} \amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ find common denominator } \\ \frac{3-2x}{x}\amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ combine fractions } \end{aligned}
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            The fraction can change sign when the numerator is zero:
            <me>
              3-2x=0\text{ when }  x=\frac{3}{2}
            </me>
            or when the denominator is zero:
            <me>
              x=0
            </me>.
          </p>

            Thus <m>\frac{3-2x}{x}</m> is positive on <m>\left(0,\frac{3}{2}\right)</m>,
            and we know that it is equal to zero at <m>x=\frac{3}{2}</m>;
            it is undefined at <m>x=0</m>.
            The equivalent inequality <m>\frac{3}{x}-2\geq 0</m> thus has solution <m>\left(0,\frac{3}{2}\right]</m>.
            Note that the second condition, <m>x\neq 0</m>,

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms and methods were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    inequality, solution set, sign analysis of products and quotients.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The solutions of inequalities are intervals of numbers.
      Multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number requires flipping the inequality.
      The sign of a product or quotient depends on the number of its negative factors.
      A polynomial can only change sign where it is equal to zero.
      A quotient of polynomials can only change sign where its numerator or denominator is equal to zero.
      In order to solve an inequality involving a product or quotient,
      algebraically manipulate the inequality so that one side is 0, then perform a sign analysis on the nonzero side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      Finding the domain of a function with an even root can involve solving an inequality.
      Writing a function involving an absolute value as a piecewise-defined function can involve solving an inequality.
