    <title><m>45-45-90</m> and <m>30-60-90</m> Triangles</title>
    <p>
      Our in-depth study of the unit circle is motivated by our desire to better understand the behavior of circular functions.
      Recall that as we traverse a circle,
      the height of the point moving along the circle generates a function that depends on distance traveled along the circle.
      Wherever possible,
      we'd like to be able to identify the exact height of a given point on the unit circle.
      Two special right triangles enable us to determine precisely an important collection of points on the unit circle.

      <title>Side Lengths of Two Important Right Triangles</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <m>45-45-90</m> right triangle and
          <m>30-60-90</m> right triangle with hypotenuse of length 1 unit have side lengths as shown in the following figures:

          <image width="75%" source="TaalmanPage403b.png"/>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The sides lengths of these triangles is a consequence of the Pythagorean Theorem:
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let's start with the <m>45-45-90</m> triangle.
        Suppose a right triangle with a hypotenuse of length 1 has two angles of 45 degrees.
        Then the triangle is an isosceles triangle;
        that is, its two legs have the same length <m>a</m>,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage404c">Figure</xref>:
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_TaalmanPage404c">
        <caption>A <m>45-45-90</m> triangle must have legs of the same length.</caption>
        <image width="28%" source="TaalmanPage404c.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        By the Pythagorean Theorem,
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}a^2+a^2 \amp = 1^2\\ 2a^2 \amp = 1\\ a^2 \amp = \frac{1}{2}\\ a \amp = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that we considered only the positive square root of
        <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> since we know that <m>a</m> is a length and thus must be positive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose that a right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 1, and angles of 30, 60, and 90 degrees.
        Let <m>a</m> be the length of the leg across from the 30-degree angle,
        and let <m>b</m> be the length of the leg across from the 60-degree angle.
        Two of these triangles together make the equilateral triangle in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage404d">Figure</xref> below:
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_TaalmanPage404d">
        <caption>A <m>30-60-90</m> triangle can be doubled to form an equilateral triangle, with all three sides the same length as the hypotenuse.</caption>
        <image width="32%" source="TaalmanPage404d.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Since this triangle is equilateral, it follows that
        <me>
          2a = 1\qquad \Longleftrightarrow\qquad a = \frac{1}{2}
        </me>.
        By the Pythagorean Theorem,
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}a^2+b^2 \amp = 1^2\\ \frac{1}{4}+b^2 \amp = 1\\ b^2 \amp =\frac{3}{4}\\ b \amp = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{aligned}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that we considered only the positive square root in this calculation since <m>b</m> is a length and must be positive.

    <title>Using Reference Triangles to Calculate Values of Sine and Cosine</title>
    <p>
      Using <m>45-45-90</m> and <m>30-60-90</m> triangles we can calculate the trigonometric functions of the angles <m>45^\circ = \frac{\pi}{4}</m> radians,
      <m>30^\circ = \frac{\pi}{6}</m> radians,
      and <m>60^\circ = \frac{\pi}{3}</m> radians.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to do this,
      we recall that for a point <m>(x,y)</m> on the unit circle (meaning,
      the circle of radius 1),
      we can interpret <m>x=\cos \theta</m> and
      <m>y=\sin\theta</m> where <m>\theta</m> is measured from the positive <m>x</m>-axis:

    <title>Calculating Values of Sine and Cosine Beyond <m>0</m> to <m>2\pi</m></title>
    <p>
      It is important to note that the values of the trigonometric functions depend only on the terminal edge of <m>\theta</m> in standard position,
      and not on how many times or in what direction the angle rotates around the unit circle.
      Therefore, angles whose terminal edges intersect the unit circle at the same point will have the same trigonometric function values.
    </p>
    <p>
      For values of <m>\theta</m> that are not between <m>0</m> and <m>2\pi</m>,
      we can find an angle between <m>0</m> and <m>2\pi</m> with the same terminal edge and calculate the values of sine as cosine with a <m>45-45-90</m> or
      <m>30-60-90</m> reference triangle as before.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_fivepioversix">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the angles <m>\frac{5\pi}{6}</m>, <m>\frac{17\pi}{6}</m>,
          and <m>-\frac{7\pi}{6}</m> all have the same terminal edge
          (check this for yourself by drawing them all in standard position!)
          and thus all have the same trigonometric values
          (this is another way to see that the sine and cosine functions have period <m>2\pi</m> as observed in the last section).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now to actually calculate, say,
          the sine and cosine of the angle <m>\frac{5\pi}{6}</m>,
          we have to know the coordinates <m>(x,y)</m> at which the terminal edge of
          <m>\frac{5\pi}{6}</m> meets the unit circle.
          You can look this up on your work from <xref ref="ex_trigvaluesonunitcircle">Exercise</xref>,
          or you can follow the method presented here.
        </p>
        <p>
          As shown below,
          we can make a reference triangle by dropping down a line from the point where the terminal edge of
          <m>\frac{5\pi}{6}</m> meets the unit circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage407a.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily for us, this reference triangle is a
          <m>30-60-90</m> triangle and therefore we already know its side lengths:
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="42%" source="TaalmanPage407b.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <m>x</m>-coordinate of the point where the terminal edge meets the unit circle tells us that
          <m>\cos(5\pi/6) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m> and the <m>y</m>-coordinate of that point tells us that <m>\sin(5\pi/6) = \frac{1}{2}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, the values of sine and cosine at
          <m>\frac{5\pi}{6}</m>, <m>\frac{17\pi}{6}</m>,
          and <m>-\frac{7\pi}{6}</m> will all be the same, thus
          <me>
            \cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = \cos\left(\frac{17\pi}{6}\right)  = \cos\left(-\frac{7\pi}{6}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{17\pi}{6}\right)  = \sin\left(-\frac{7\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Verify that <m>\frac{5\pi}{6}</m>, <m>\frac{17\pi}{6}</m>,
          and <m>-\frac{7\pi}{6}</m> all have the same terminal edge by drawing all three in standard position on the same coordinate plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then use the values of <m>\cos(5\pi/6)</m> and
          <m>\sin(5\pi/6)</m> from <xref ref="ex_fivepioversix">Exercise</xref>
          to determine the value of <m>\tan(5\pi/6)</m>.
          Because the three angles have the same terminal edge,
          this is also the value of <m>\tan(17\pi/6)</m> and of <m>\tan(-7\pi/6)</m>.

    <p>
      For angles whose reference triangles are not our convenient
      <m>30-60-90</m> or <m>45-45-90</m> triangles,
      we must resort to calculating trigonometric values with a calculator.
      This is the same as needing to use a calculator to find the values of
      <m>f(x) = \log_b x</m> for all values of <m>x</m> that are not powers of the base <m>b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing to note is that you may need to change the mode of your calculator depending on whether you are working with degrees or radians.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, with a calculator in <em>degree mode</em>,
          we can approximate that <m>\cos 12^\circ\approx 0.978</m> and that <m>\sin 75^\circ\approx 0.966</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          With a calculator in <em>radian mode</em>
          we can approximate <m>\cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\approx 0.809</m>.
          We can verify that this makes sense with a picture.
          As shown in the picture below,
          it does seem realistic that the angle <m>-\frac{\pi}{5}</m>
          (which is one-fifth of the way clockwise on the bottom half of the unit circle)
          meets the unit circle at a point whose <m>x</m>-coordinate is approximately <m>0.809</m>
          (relatively close to <m>1</m>).

    </example>
    <p>
      It is essential to keep track of which units are being used and to check that the answer on a calculator makes sense with the position of the angle on the unit circle.
      After all, our tools are only as smart as we are!

    <title>Right-Triangle Trigonometry</title>
    <p>
      There is another standard approach to defining the trigonometric functions,
      at least for <em>acute</em> angles,
      meaning angles measure between <m>0^\circ</m> and <m>90^\circ</m>.
      Sine, cosine,
      and tangent can be defined in terms of side lengths of triangles.
      Every acute angle <m>\theta</m> can be realized as part of a right triangle with opposite and adjacent sides as labeled in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage402a">Figure</xref> below:
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_TaalmanPage402a">
      <caption>Opposite and adjacent sides to an acute angle. The hypotenuse is opposite the right angle.</caption>
      <image width="42%" source="TaalmanPage402a.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      For any given acute angle there are many possible right triangles that we could draw,
      but as illustrated in <xref ref="fig_TaalmanPage402b">Figure</xref>,
      all of the possibilities will have the same three angles and thus be similar triangles.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_TaalmanPage402b">
      <caption>Right triangles with the same acute angles must be similar.</caption>
      <image width="42%" source="TaalmanPage402b.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This relationship is key,
      since the Law of Similar Triangles tells us that the similar triangles may have different side lengths,
      but always have the same <em>ratios</em> of side lengths:
      <me>
        \frac{a}{b} = \frac{A}{B},\qquad \frac{a}{c} = \frac{A}{C}, \qquad \frac{b}{c} = \frac{B}{C}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have defined three of the functions that result from these ratios already:
      sine results from the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse,
      cosine results from the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse,
      and tangent results from the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
      There are three other trigonometric functions that we have not yet mentioned that result from the reciprocals of these ratios:
      cosecant, secant, and cotangent, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following definition, "opp," "adj," and "hyp" denote the lengths of the opposite side,
      adjacent side, and hypotenuse, respectively:

      <title>Trigonometric Functions for Acute Angles</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given an acute angle <m>\theta</m>,
          the six <em>trigonometric functions</em>
          are defined as the following six ratios of side lengths:
          <ol marker="labelalphitemsep5pt">
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\sin\theta = \frac{\text{ opp } }{\text{ hyp } }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\csc\theta = \frac{\text{ hyp } }{\text{ opp } } = \frac{1}{\sin\theta}</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\cos\theta = \frac{\text{ adj } }{\text{ hyp } }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\sec\theta = \frac{\text{ hyp } }{\text{ adj } } = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\tan\theta = \frac{\text{ opp } }{\text{ adj } } = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\cot\theta = \frac{\text{ adj } }{\text{ opp } } = \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is worth noting in particular that
          <m>\cot\theta = \frac{1}{\tan\theta}</m> for most values of <m>\theta</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="ex_3-4-5">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          consider the angle <m>\theta</m> shown in the <m>3-4-5</m> right triangle shown below:
        </p>
        <p>
          The side lengths here are opp<m>=3</m>,
          adj<m>=4</m>, and hyp<m>=5</m>.
          The ratios of these side lengths give us
          <me>
            \sin\theta = \frac{3}{5},\cos\theta = \frac{4}{5},\tan\theta  = \frac{3}{4}
          </me>
          <me>
            \csc\theta = \frac{5}{3}, \sec\theta = \frac{5}{4},\cot\theta = \frac{4}{3}

          The same angle <m>\theta</m> as in <xref ref="ex_3-4-5">Example</xref>
          can be thought of inside the <m>6-8-10</m> triangle:

        </p>
        <p>
          Although all the side lengths are twice as large,
          their ratios will be exactly the same.
          Find <m>\sin\theta</m>, <m>\cos\theta</m>,
          and <m>\tan\theta</m> using the side lengths in the <m>6-8-10</m> triangle,
          and simplify in order to verify that they are the same as in <xref ref="ex_3-4-5">Example</xref>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      The right-triangle definitions of sine,
      cosine and tangent for acute angles are compatible with the original definitions via the unit circle.
      Acute angles in standard position must terminate in the first quadrant,
      as illustrated below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <image width="37%" source="TaalmanPage406b.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the radius of the circle is 1, then the hypotenuse of the triangle is 1, and so we can see that
      <me>
        \sin\theta = \frac{\text{ opp } }{\text{ hyp } } = \frac{y}{1} = y
      </me>
      <me>
        \cos\theta =  \frac{\text{ adj } }{\text{ hyp } } = \frac{x}{1} = x
      </me>
      <me>
        \tan\theta = \frac{\text{ opp } }{\text{ adj } } = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The functions cosecant, secant,
      and cotangent are defined for arbitrary angles as the reciprocals of sine, cosine,
      and tangent, respectively, just as they are for acute angles.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        One thing to notice is that it is not necessary to use the <em>unit</em>
        circle to define the sine and cosine functions.
        It is simply convenient.
        We see from the right-triangle definitions that any size radius will give us the same value for sine and cosine,
        provided that we take the <em>ratio</em>
        of the side lengths to the radius.
        So we could define
        <me>
          \sin\theta = \frac{y}{r}\text{ and } \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r}
        </me>
        if we choose to use a circle of radius <m>r</m>, instead of radius 1.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Now that we have formally defined all six of the trigonometric functions,
      here is one more example of calculating the values of the trigonometric functions by hand using a reference triangle:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_negative11piover4">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Sketch the angle <m>-\frac{11\pi}{4}</m> in standard position,
          and then use the unit circle to find the values of all six trigonometric functions of that angle.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Note that
          <me>
            -\frac{11\pi}{4} = -\frac{8\pi}{4}-\frac{3\pi}{4} = -2\pi-\frac{3\pi}{4}
          </me>.
          Since <m>2\pi</m> radians is one full revolution around the unit circle,
          the angle <m>-\frac{11\pi}{4}</m> opens up in the clockwise direction for one full revolution and then an additional three-quarters of the bottom half of the unit circle,
          as shown at the left:
        </p>
        <p>
          <image width="93%" source="TaalmanPage410a.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the right-hand picture above,
          we see a <m>45-45-90</m> reference triangle with the labeled side lengths of <m>\sqrt{2}/2</m>.
          Because the angle terminates in Quadrant III, both coordinates of the point on the unit circle are negative.
          By the unit-circle definitions of sine and cosine,
          <me>
            (x.y) =\left(\cos\left(-\frac{11\pi}{4}\right),\sin\left(-\frac{11\pi}{4}\right)\right)= \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore
          <me>
            \cos\left(-\frac{11\pi}{4}\right) =-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \text{ and }  \sin\left(-\frac{11\pi}{4}\right) =-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

        </p>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms and theorems were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    Side lengths of <m>45-45-90</m> and <m>30-60-90</m> triangles, reference triangle; degree mode and radian mode of a calculator; the cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> We can use <m>45-45-90</m> and
      <m>30-60-90</m> triangles to find the exact values of trigonometric functions for certain angles by drawing the angles in standard position and using a reference triangle to label the corresponding point on the unit circle,
      whose coordinates are the values of cosine and sine of the angle.
      There are alternate definitions for sine and cosine using right triangles,
      and we can define all six trigonometric functions in terms of ratios of side lengths of right triangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced or reinforced:</em>
      The quadrant of the terminal edge of the angle determines the signs of the coordinates of the points,
      thus the signs of sine and cosine.
      Sine and cosine are periodic functions,
      with period equal to <m>2\pi</m> radians,
      meaning that their values repeat after one full rotation around the unit circle.
